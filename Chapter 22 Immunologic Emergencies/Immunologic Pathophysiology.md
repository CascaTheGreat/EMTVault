Allergic reactions can be mild or systemic. Local reactions are limited to set areas, while systemic can be anywhere. Medications produce the most allergy-related deaths.

Anaphylaxis is mediated by [[Immunologic Anatomy and Physiology Review|IgE antibodies]], **anaphylactoid reactions** do not involve them. Exact process isn't known, but can happen even before prior exposure. Anaphylactic triggers are things like nuts and fish, anaphylactoid triggers are aspirin, morphine-based meds, and contrasts for radiology. 

**Histamines** cause local vessel dilation and capillary leakage. **Leukotrienes** are stronger, cause more dilation and leakage. WBC and platelets usually overreact, causing symptoms. In systemic, histamines hit first and then more chemicals later.

| Mediator | Effect |
| ---- | ---- |
| Histamine | Vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, vessel permeability, decreased cardiac contractility |
| Leukotrienes | Wayyy more potent and slower reacting than histamine |
| Platelet-activators | Platelet aggregation, histamine release |
| Serotonin | Pulmonary vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction |

**Angioedema** is swelling of face and tongue, caused by histamines. Can also present with **urticaria** (hives). Histamines also cause smooth muscle contraction, inducing laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and abd cramping. Dysrhythmias from hypoperfusion and hypoxia can occur.
Leukotrienes worsen these, also causing coronary vasoconstriction to mess up the hear more.
**Pruritus**/itching is an early sign, angioedema can block airway, stridor or hoarseness, maybe wheezes or crackles in the lower airway. Progresses fast, you have 1-3 mins to stop it.
CNS symptoms like a sense of doom or confusion indicate bad perfusion. Treat them like they have 3 types of shock - cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and neurogenic.
