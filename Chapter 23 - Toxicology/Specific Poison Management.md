### Alcohol
Over 14 million US adults have been alcoholics. **Alcoholism** is the fourth leading US cause of death, 6% of deaths worldwide. 
Works as a CNS depressant, is a [[Toxidromes#^c886b1|sedative-hypnotic]]. Look for head trauma, toxic reaction, or uncontrolled diabetes. Drinking a lot at once can cause hypoglycemia. Most instant threat is respiratory depression or aspiration of emesis.
Minor withdrawal is note by restlessness, anxiety, sleeping issues, tremors and agitation. Major withdrawal presents with raised BP, emesis, and hallucinations. **Delirium tremens** has tremors, restlessness, weakness, fever, hallucinations, hypotension, seizures, and maybe death. Give 100mg thiamine if indicated. Hepatitis is common with chronic drinkers, so is cirrhosis.

Maintain airway, placing in recovery position if gag reflex is present. Otherwise, adjunct and bag, and consider calling a paramedic. Always check glucose and treat results, suspect internal bleeding if shock symptoms (chronic drinking messes w clotting). If seizing, treat as before and call a paramedic to give benzos. Establish vascular access and manage hypotension with saline.

### Opioids
Also a CNS suppressant, also called an **opiate** if derived from an opium plant. Used for pain suppression in clinical environments, though variants are popular illicit drugs. Drugs like heroin are continually metabolizing. Narcan can reverse opioid OD, ideally give IV. Make sure to maintain airway and O2 sat.

### Stimulants
Stuff like coke and meth, very abusable. When effects wear off, user crashes, seeing depression, irritability and exhaustion. Treat meth labs as HAZMAT. Maintain O2 sat, sedate to prevent seizures, consider paramedic airway intervention. Also call paramedics for seizure and anxiety control. Manage hyperthermia and provide fluid therapy.

### Marijuana and Cannabis Compounds
Dried leaves of the cannabis sativa plant. Distorted sense of time and space, bronchodilation and mild tachycardia.
**Spice** is a mix of synth cannaboids sold as incense. Can cause psychosis, hallucinations, tachycardia, emesis and renal issues. Supportive care, benzos and transport.

### Hallucinogens
Alter sensory perception. Serious side effects are rare, seizures and hyperthermia can happen. Nausea, emesis, mydriasis, and slight tachycardia happen often. Treatment is mainly supportive, avoid stimulation and give benzos if they want to fight.

### Sedative-hypnotics
Loads of uses. **Barbiturates** used to be sleep aids and anxiety meds, but ppl used them kill themselves and accidentally OD.
**Benzodiazepines** are used a lot prehospital. OD presents with drowsy, confusion, slurred speech, ataxia. Do airway management, paramedics can give flumazenil but this is rare prehospital.

### Cardiac Medications
Help pts with cardiac issues, often taken in combos, OD presents usually with hypotension, weakness, confusion, nausea, emesis, headache and dyspnea. Give fluid boluses, get vascular access, consider calling for a paramedic.

### Other Meds
Give fluids for hypotension from **ED meds**.

**Antidepressants** OD presents with AMS, dysrhythmias, blurred vision, dry mouth, urinary retention, pulmonary edema, constipation.

**Monoamine oxidase inhibitors** can cause hypertensive crises when taken with foods with tyramine (beer, wine, cheese, sour cream). Symptoms 6-12 hrs later, hyperactivity, dysrhythmias, hyperventilation, nystagmus. Increased toxicity can be chest pain, hypertensions, diaphoresis. Keep airway, activated charcoal, saline, transport.

**SSRIs** OD presetn with nausea, emesis, dysrhythmias, sedation, tremors, dilate pupils.

**Lithium** OD is nausea, vomiting, tremors, excessive thirst, slurred speech, later ataxia, twitches, and blurred vision. Give O2 and saline.

**GHB** is common sexual assault drug. Acts like a hypnotic, maintain airway and oxygen, rapid transport.

### Organophosphates
Big in insecticides and nerve gases. Presents with salivation, mucus secretion, urination, lacrimation, and a fucked up heart. Use SLUDGEM.

### Carbon monoxide
One of the most common fatal poisonings. If everyone in a house has a headache and flu symptoms, suspect monoxide poisoning and evac. More severe in children. Cherry red color is a very late sign. Check SpCO.

### Metals
Lead is bad :). Airway, oxygen, vascular access, but no fluids unless cerebral edema.

### Hydrocarbons
Huffing paint basically, causes respiratory distress and sometimes hypoglycemia/dysrhythmias.

### Food Poisoning
If two or more ppl are sick at the same time and scene, thing food or monoxide poisoning. GI complaints, emesis and diarrhea, possibly causing hypotension. Give oxygen and vascular access.
