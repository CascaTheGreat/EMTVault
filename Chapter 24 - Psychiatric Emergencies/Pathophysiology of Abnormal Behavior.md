Can be physical or psychological.

## Organic (physical) Causes
**Organic brain syndrome** is a dysfunction caused by a disturbance in the physical or physiologic function of the brain tissue. Can be caused by trauma, seizures, drugs, OD, withdrawal, and disease.
**PTSD** stems from the anxiety of stress, and can be caused by things from military service to car accidents.

## Functional (psych) Disorders
Can't be traced to physical damage, not 100% the brain tissue's fault. Schizophrenia, anxiety and depression are functional.
