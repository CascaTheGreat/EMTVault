**Behavior** is a person's actions and visible response.
A **behavioral crisis** is a reaction that interferes with the **activities of daily living** or is unacceptable to the patient or those around them. 

Chronic **depression** is a persistent feeling of sadness and despair, and is considered a mental health disorder.
People who cannot respond appropriately to the environment may be having a psychological or p**sychiatric emergency**. They may be violent to themselves or others. These situations are more dangerous than behavioral emergencies. Immediate threat to the person and any others in the area should be treated as a psychiatric emergency.
