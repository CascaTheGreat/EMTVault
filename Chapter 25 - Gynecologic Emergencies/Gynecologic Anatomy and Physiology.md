See [[Reproductive System]]. The uppermost part of the uterus is the **fundus**, uterus also made of the principal uterine mass, the uterine cavity, the inner **endometrium** layer and the muscular **myometrium** wall.
The clitoris is covered by the **prepuce**, the small space at the beginning of the vagina is the **vestibule**. The **perineum** (pelvic floor) lies between the vulva and anus.

### Physiology
The menstrual cycle is driven by monthly hormone. If no fertilized egg implants in the uterus, the uterine lining sheds (roughly every 28 days). Initial onset is **menarche**, cessation is **menopause**. **Premenstrual syndrome** occurs 7-14 days before onset of flow (fluid retention, breast pain, headache, cramping, emotional changes)
**Amenorrhea** is the absences of menses (time of menstruation). Common in athletes, or when body fat is low, or by stress.
