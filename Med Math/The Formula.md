**VOH** = Volume on hand, liquid in the container (IV bags like 100, 250, 500, or 1000mL)
**DOH** = Drug on Hand
**DO** = Doctor's Order
**Wt.** = Weight in KG (only if DO in mcg/kg/min)
**DS** = [[Drips|Drip Set]]
**Time** = Duration over which to give

Volume to give = (VOH \* DO) / DOH
**Honestly just use [stoichiometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta/x2eef969c74e0d802:chemical-reactions/x2eef969c74e0d802:stoichiometry/a/stoichiometry)**
Rate in gtt/min = (**VOH** \* DO \* Wt. \* DS) / Time
