- **Intracellular fluid** is inside the cells (2/3 of fluids)
- **Extracellular fluid** is outside (1/3 of fluids)
	- Intravascular is between cells
	- Interstitial is outside the vascular bed.

[[-tonic Solutions|Isotonic solutions]] have the same salt concentration as serum.
Electrolytes are dissolved salt that can conduct electricity. Potassium (biggest in cells) follows sodium(biggest in blood and interstitial).

Give blood products to improve clotting and intravascular expansion.

Fluid bolus/challenge is a large volume of IV fluid pushed fast.
