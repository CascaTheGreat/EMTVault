### Rain and Fog
Affects visibility in two ways - reduce warning capability and creates glare.

Broken or cracked windshields must be fixed.
Use visors above the windshield to not look into the sun. Bug screens can deflect bugs and light rain and snow over the windshield.

Prepare yourself for visibility concerns, turn on low beams and wipers if needed, watch for stopped/slow vehicles, check side views frequently. Drive slow, but don't stop. If you have to stop, pull over all the way, leave lights and hazards on.
