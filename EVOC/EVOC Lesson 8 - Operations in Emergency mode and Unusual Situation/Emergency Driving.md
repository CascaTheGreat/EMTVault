State statutes determine speed, but try to stay in the speed limit.

Signaling devices (lights and siren) notify other drivers of your approach and request they yield the right of way. Most drivers will yield if they know you're there, sufficient time is available, and there is time and space to do so. Lights and siren cannot guarantee you the right of way, and some drivers just won't give you the right of way. Signaling actually increases your crash danger.

In a response, though speed is needed, the time-saving methods can be harmful and the time saved won't really matter.

Speed limits are based on road quality and normal traffic conditions. When you approach, shit isn't normal. Sirens really only warn vehicles going the same way and pedestrians, not drivers head on or on converging roads. Rural ppl going 55 with the radio on may not hear the wail until 33 feet away. In city traffic, open windows and no radio might not hear more than 123 feet away.

60% of crashes happen at intersections with stop signs or traffic lights.

Don't enter opposing traffic until all vehicles are aware of you. Don't enter a one-way against traffic until all traffic has yielded.
