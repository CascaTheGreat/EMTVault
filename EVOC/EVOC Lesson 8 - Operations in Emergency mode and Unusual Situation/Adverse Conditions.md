These conditions affect traction and vision.

### Rain
 - Layer of water on the road can cause hydroplaning, losing control of steering and breaking.
 - Large areas of water can wet the brakes and make them worse.
 - Water only in one portion, vehicle will tend to pull to that direction dependent on depth and speed.
 - Slow before hitting water, gently apply brakes as you leave deep puddles to dry the brakes.
### Snow and Ice
- Form a slick barrier, hurts braking and turning. Bridges and shaded roads freeze first. Go in a low gear in snow and move slow.
### High winds
- Cross winds can blow the vehicles off road or over the median. Reduce speed to lessen the effects.
### Leaves
- Treat wet leaves like ice or snow - they can be just as slick.

In general, reduce speed, and use snow tires if appropriate.
