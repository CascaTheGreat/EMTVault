Drive to avoid situations with unavoidable crashes. Severity is almost always decreased if the driver keeps driving. Decide what and how to hit if it's unavoidable.

To recover from off the road:
- Remove foot from accelerator
- Continue to drive
- Slow and regain control
- Signal intentions
- Pull back onto the road
Check your side view mirrors, and you may be forced to go straight back on.
