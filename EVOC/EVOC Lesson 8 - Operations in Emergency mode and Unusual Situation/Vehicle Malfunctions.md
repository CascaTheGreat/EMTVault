 - Tire blowout (sway with rear tire, swerve with front, don't brake and ease off accelerator, once control regained pullover)
 - Brake failure (Try pumping brakes, shift to lower gear and engine brake, applying parking brakes carefully)
 - Steering failure (slow and pull off the road, don't brake heavily)
 - Stuck accelerator (shift to neutral and get stopped asap, if engine isn't stopped it will probably fail) 
 - Released hood (look through small gap and pull over, worst case look through side window)
Plan pull over, brake smoothly, parking out of traffic flow
