You get them to the hospital fast without making the pt condition worse. 

**Asphalt** isn't too durable, needs to be patched often. Slick in heat and rain.
**Concrete** expands and may break up during hot weather. Settles more than others, causing dips. Glazes faster in freezing weather.
**Dirt/Gravel** are tough to drive on, move easy and slides often. Stay back when following other vehicles.

Potholes can destroy tires or suspension and can cause loss of control. Pass info on to dispatch about potholes. If you have to hit it, release your brakes just as you get to it and hit it squarely. 

Don't swerve at objects: hit small ones head on, try to calmly avoid large objects.

Bridges often have metal grating, jerkin the tires. Slowly approach and firmly hold the wheel. Never take curves for granted and follow speed limit.

When roads have "crowns", the center is higher than the edges, used in places with lots of rain. Slow down on corners.

Four driving skills are cornering, braking, accelerating, and maintaining speed.

Patients will tense muscles to counteract turns, braking, and accelerating. Bad for internal injuries and broken limbs.
Do CPR at below 25 mph.

Suspension keeps all wheels on the ground and isolate the body from bumps. Stopping time is reaction time + breaking time.
**2-4-12 rules**
- Stay 2 seconds between the vehicles ahead below 55mph
- Stay 4 seconds behind over 55 mph
- Look 12 seconds ahead for hazards and alternate paths
Simplify your choices, avoid all possible hazards

Maintain a safety cushion - keep a cushion of empty space to avoid other vehicles and hazards.
Emergency units responding on the same route should maintain 300-400 ft distance. Use a different siren tone than vehicles ahead of you, changing tones at intersections and partially wind down so motorists know multiple vehicles are in the area.

Always secure loose items, keep doors locked, and wear seat belts. Crew matters more than vehicle.
Reduce speed of impact, then angle, than size/hardness of object, strike with part furthest from you, only you can move the ambulance.

Pass stopped traffic only after you know why they stopped.

Always use a ground guide when backing, do it when you first arrive if needed. Position the body to use the side mirrors, go ten and two, slowly accelerate, and minimize hand movement.

When you can't have two people in the cab, slow down and always look twice. 

In rural areas, look for loose livestock, buses or children, and slow-moving vehicles such as tractors and farm equipment.

On highways, maintain speed and only decelerate on the exit ramp. Accelerate to the speed of traffic, and progress lane by lane to the far left lane (in emergency mode). Do yelp mode on the highway.

Passing slower vehicles on a two-lane at 55 needs more than half a mile of space.
