Use a ground guide, position yourself 2-3 feet from parked vehicles on the right. Stop when your body is lined up with the center of the spot. Choose a 45 degree target, creep forward to it and make the tires straight. Reverse, look over the right shoulder, and aim for the parking spot. Back to the rear pivot point, creep and turn, straighten into the space, and creep into the rear parking line
