It's your job to make sure the vehicle is safe to operate, mechanical failures with serious consequence may make you liable. You assume personal responsibility for your ambulance's operating condition. Visually inspect, ensure scheduled maintenance is done, and repairs have been made

Major systems include: 
- engine/drive train (large engine, usually automatic)
- cooling system (check fluid level daily)
- braking system (drum are older but widely used, newer use disc brakes, sometimes both, ABS are good on snow and ice.)
- electrical system (often auxiliary power system, small generator powered by engine, power lights and BLS when parked or heavy load, typically in the rear)
- environmental control (AC)
- support equipment (oxygen bottles, stretchers, med devices, comms and rescue equipment)

Quick check (appendix C) covers most checked systems. Full check (appendix D) covers everything possible without special equipment.

1. Overall appearance (clean, sitting level, puddles, new damage)
2. Operator compartment(check log, item stowage, switches off, mirrors + seat adjust, pop hood, check fuel)
3. Operator's side exterior (general left side condition)
4. Front exterior (light, grill)
5. Engine compartment (visually check engine, belts, batteries, oil and cooling fluid)
6. Passenger side exterior (general condition)
7. PT compartment (check equipment, ensure doors latched)
8. Rear exterior (Lights, turn signals, rear wheels)

Start and drive outdoors, check comms, siren, lights, secure equipment and return to parking spot.

Failing to inspect or knowingly driving an unsafe vehicle may be negligence. Document needed maintenance and ensure it is done, or do it yourself.
