Dispatch will coordinate call for an ambulance service. You must routinely communicate with dispatch and other responders.

Report pre-run, when dispatched, upon arrival, at scene to update, before departure, en route, arrival, and return to station.

Operator should focus on getting to scene safely, passenger EMT should communicate whenever possible. Operator will usually talk when they are leaving the scene or arriving at the ER. Limit radio traffic to only what is needed.

Plan messages first, identify yourself and unit, be brief, clear, and plain. Repeat directions given.
