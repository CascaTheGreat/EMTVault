In the event of an ambulance fire, pull over, evac the vehicle, and attempt to extinguish the fire. If possible, shut off the engine and oxygen tanks.

Flashlights can work to warn, but give them to a bystander with a safety vest. Vests should be used by anyone near the flow of traffic. 

Triangles should be 300 ft right of lane, 150 ft middle lane, 100 ft in the right of left lane, one at head of vehicle. Use especially with hazardous materials. Flares are placed in the same spots. Time gated, so put one's head next to the base of another to extend time. Don't light inside or near dry vegetation

Make the vehicle easy to pack and depart, usually park in the street, not driveway. This is overridden by the need for patient care.

Park at least 50 feet from vehicle accidents, let scene commander direct you. Park to not block traffic.

Safety of access: if a side or two can't be accessed due to flow of traffic, it's bad. All compartments should be accessible.
Don't use the vehicle for scene protection, let police or fire do it.
Park paying attention to safety, traffic flow, ease of departure, and distance from patient.

Get far away from power lines.
