As skin is destroyed by a burn, the tough, leathery substance of **eschar** is created.

Burns have three progressions, called zones. The central zone that suffers the most damage is the **coagulation zone**, where there is little-no blood flow. Surrounding it, tissue is inflamed and blood flow decreased, called the **stasis zone**. Can necrose in 1-2 days if untreated. The **hyperemia zone** cells will recover in 7-10 days.

 - Superficial/1st degree burns only hurt the top layer, red and painful
 - Partial-thickness/2nd degree hits some of the dermis, moist, mottled and white/red, blisters and intensely painful.
 - Full-thickness/3rd degree may involve sq, muscle, bone, dry and leathery, may be white, dark brown, or charred. Eschar happens here.

**Rule of nines** approximates the TBSA, 9% in most areas and 18% in some. Alternatively, use the **rule of palms** where each palm is 1% of their TBSA. Try to determine burn type.

During lengthy transport, you may give fluids based on the **Consensus formula**. 2-4ml times pt weight in kgs times TBSA percentage = fluid in 24 hours. 

**Thermal burns** are caused by heat. A **flame burn** is often deep, especially if clothing catches fire. **Scald burns** happen when hot liquids contact skin. **Contact burns** are caused by contact with hot objects, rare unless the pt has been prevented from withdrawing. **Steam burns** can produce a scald burn, can happen in explosions or lightning strikes.

**Inhalation injuries** occur when the upper airway is exposed to high heat. Can cause coughing, wheezing, edema of the upper airway indicated by stridor. Consider calling for a paramedic if a patient has AMS.
Treat carbon monoxide poisoning with lots of oxygen and know that spo2 numbers might be wrong.

For severe chemical burns, consider hazmat. severity depends on pH, concentration, exposure time and volume. Brush off dry chemicals before washing. Flood the area for 15 to 20 minutes after burning pain has stopped. Don't use neutralizing agents.
 - Dry lime - remove clothes, brush, and flood with garden hose or shower
 - Sodium - cover with oil
 - Hydrofluoric acid - Calcium gluconate gel
 - Gasoline or diesel - wash asap, use soap solution
 - Hot tar - technically thermal burns, immerse in cold water, don't try to remove in the field

In **electrical burns**, there will be a small entrance wound and a large exit wound. Force of energy can also cause fractures or dislocations. If it flows through the heart, it can disrupt the cardiac conduction system.
