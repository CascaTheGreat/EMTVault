### Closed Injuries
Small stuff doesn't involve much more than a bandaid. For closed injury to extremities, do RICES: rest, ice, compression, elevate, splint.

### Open Injuries
If wound is chest, upper abd, or upper back, cover with occlusive dressing.

### Specific Wounds
Never remove skin flaps from avulsions, if complete, wrap the separated tissue in gauze and take it to the ED.
In amputations, stop bleed and give IV. Do not detach, and bring it if complete.
