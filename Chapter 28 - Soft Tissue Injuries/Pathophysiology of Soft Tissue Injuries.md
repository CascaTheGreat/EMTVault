Three types:
- Closed injury
- Open injury
- Burns

### Closed Injuries
Caused by blunt trauma, swelling below the skin, and discoloration. A **contusion** is bleeding beneath the skin. As fluid leaks into the damaged area, the buildup of blood produces the blue or black **ecchymosis**. 
**Hematoma** is a pool of blood collected within damaged tissue.
**Crush syndrome** is when tissue necrosis develops and releases bad shit into the blood. Metabolic by-products are released, but not circulated to be dealt with. Upon freeing the limb, stuff can be released into circulation. This can cause cardiac arrest if lots of potassium are released. Get IV access before freeing limbs, give rehydration if possible before release of compression. 
If excess leaking and swelling occurs, pressure can compress the vessels and stop flow, called **compartment syndrome**. Characterized by out of proportion pain.

### Open Injuries
**Contamination** is the presence of infectious organisms in the wound. 

An **abrasion** is a wound to the superficial skin, blood will ooze. Though blood loss is minimal, fluid loss can be substantial over large areas. 
A **laceration** is a cut cause by sharp or blunt object that tears the skin. May be a line(linear) or irregular(stellate). May damage arteries or veins.
An **avulsion** is an injury that separates the various layers of soft tissue, creating a flap. A completely avulsed body part is an **amputation**.
A **puncture wound** is from a sharp object. If item is still there, stabilize and transport.
**Evisceration** is when organs protrude through an open wound. Open neck injuries may suck in air through neck veins and cause an air embolism.

### Pathophysiology of Wound healing
**Gangrene** is dead tissue caused by interrupted blood supply (dry gangrene). When caused by infection, it is wet gangrene.
**Tetanus** is bacterial infection, bacteria produces toxin that creates powerful muscle contractions.
**Fasciitis** is the inflammation of the fascia that covers vessels and muscles. The most serious form is **necrotizing fasciitis**, which kills tissue.
