 - Isotonic: Saline, lactated Ringer
 - Hypotonic: D5W
 - Hypertonic: 3% saline, blood, albumin

**Isotonic solutions** have similar **osmolarity** (particle concentration) as most body fluids. Expand the intravascular compartment w/o affecting fluid elsewhere - hydrates but can overload, causing fluid buildup in lungs. D5W is isotonic before being metabolized.

**Hypotonic solutions** have lower Na concentration, pulling water into cells from vascular to interstitial and then cells. Can cause  ICP, often used in stroke or head trauma. Use in burns or trauma can cause **third spacing**, shifting fluid to the organ covering membrane.

**Hypertonic solutions** have higher ionic concentration, pulling fluid into the vascular from the cells. Stabilized BP, rarely used prehospital.
