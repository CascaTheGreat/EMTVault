## Notification
Someone tells EMS that an emergency exists and communicates with dispatch (Calling 911). Dispatch decides the severity and what level of response to send.

## Dispatch
The dispatcher contacts the crew and relays information like the location and details from the caller. Inform dispatch when you arrive on scene and anything obvious during size-up.

## En Route Comms
After dispatch, the dispatcher can return to the call with the original caller to get further information. Report significant changes in condition to medical control, and transport info back to the station after returning.

## Communicating with Medical Control
This is the main reason for radio comms. Ask medical control for advice in special situations or contexts not covered in offline direction. Plan communication before starting transmission. A typical transmission of patient report should include:
1. Receiving hospital, unit ID, level of cert, and status
2. PT age, sex, weight. (not name)
3. Desc. of scene
4. LOC, chief complaint, severity and symptoms
5. History of injury
6. Physical findings/vitals
7. Care given and response
8. ETA
9. Ask for questions
