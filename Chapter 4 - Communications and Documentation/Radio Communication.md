All radio operations are regulated by the **FCC**. Specific frequencies are set for EMS providers, base stations are licensed, equipment is licensed, and power output is limited.

**Base stations** are  pieces of hardware with a transmitter and receiver that dispatch typically uses to communicate with ambulances. Base stations typically are more powerful and cover larger areas.

**Mobile radios** are installed within ambulances and are less powerful than base stations. The most common frequency bands for medical use is the VHF and UHF bands (the MED channels). UHF has shorter range, but is usually better in dense buildings.

**Repeaters** receive messages on one frequency and repeat them on another. This capability allows them to extend the range of radio communications.
