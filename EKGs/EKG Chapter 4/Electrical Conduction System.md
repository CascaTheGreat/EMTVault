Electrical signals follow this pathway:
1. SA Node
2. AV Node
3. Bundle of His
4. R/L Bundle Branches
5. Purkinje Fibers

P wave is atrial depolarization, QRS is ventricular depolarization, T wave is ventricular repolarization.

The SA node is the **primary pacemaker**, firing 60-100 times a minute. Located in upper posterior of the right atrial wall.
The Internodal pathways receive the SA node's impulse and transmit it to the AV node. **Bachmann's bundle** connects the SA node to the left atrium.
The **atrioventricular node** is on the floor of the right atrium, delayed about 0.05 seconds. Only pathway of atrial impulses to ventricles. Intrinsic rate of 40-60. Joins the bundle of His at the **AV junction**. **Junctional tissue** can initiate electrical activity.
The **bundle of His** is at the interventricular septum, called the **common bundle**. Produces QRS complex.
