Drugs are scheduled based on addiction and medical use.
I - High abuse, no medical use (heroin, weed, LSD)
II - High abuse, medical use (fentanyl, cocaine)
III - Less abusable (Hydrocodone, tylenol w codeine, ketamine)
IV - Even less abusable (Diazepam, lorazepam)
V - Even less abusable (narcotic cough meds)

**Teratogenic** drugs pose a risk to the health or development of a fetus.

Drugs that do the same thing as the hormones of the sympathetic nervous system are **sympathomimetics**. **Sympatholytics** inhibit the nervous system. The sympathetic response is called **adrenergic**. Many patient take beta-blockers to control blood pressure and dysrhythmias, they block the beta receptors that would normally increase heart rate and dilate the vessels.

Agonists to the parasympathetic system are **parasympathomimetic**, antagonists are **parasympatholytics**. Parasympathomimetics are also **cholinergic** because they stimulate cholinergic receptors. If it binds and blocks acetylcholine, it is a **anticholinergic**. If it interacts with AChE, ACh does not deactivate. Excess cholinergics cause SLUDGEM.

**Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists** block ACh only at muscarinic receptors. Atropine is one of these.

**Analgesics** relieve pain, **opioid agonists**(usually prescribed) bind to opiate receptors to stop pain signals. Fentanyl is fast and strong, but lasts short.
**Nonopioid analgesics** are often OTC, some are antipyretic. Big ones are salicylates (aspirin), **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** like ibuprofen, and para-aminophenol (acetaminophen).

Narcan is an **opioid antagonist**. **Opioid agonist-antagonists** reduce pain but don't diminish the respiratory system.

**Benzos** are sedatives, probably increase the affinity of GABA for GABA receptors. Barbiturates work similarly (probably). **Nonbarbiturate hypnotics** do the same, but less side effects.
**Dissociative anesthetics** like ketamine maintain BP and HR, but raise ICP so no head injuries.

**Anticonvulsants** stop seizures, probably by keeping sodium from the cell.

**Stimulants** excite the CNS, either by increasing exciting transmitters or decreasing inhibitors. Caffeine, coke, and amphetamines release dopamine and norepinephrine.

**Depressants** slow brain activity, often used in anxiety or stress. Lorazepam, diazepam, alprazolam (Xanax), zolpidem tartrate (Ambien).

Psychotherapeutic drugs block dopamine receptors. Treats schizophrenia, but often has side effects. **Extrapyramidal symptoms** are involuntary movements, tremors, restlessness.

**Chronotropics** affect the heart rate, **inotropics**, change the force of contraction, **dromotropics** affect the velocity of electric conduction in the heart. Positive raise function, negative decrease.

**Cardiac glycosides** block ionic pumps in hear cells. Rare use and tons of side effects.

**Antidysrhythmic medications** treat dysrhythmias. Some are negative dromotropics(sodium and calcium channel blockers), and reduce adrenergic stimulation (beta blockers), some are positive inotropics (potassium channel blockers).

**Antihypertensives** treat hypertension.
**Diuretics** (water pills) remove excess salt and water, lowering total fluid volume and stroke volume.
**Vasodilators** like nitro tell the smooth vessel muscle to dilate. Dilation often activates sympathetic response.
**Sympathetic** blockers like beta-blockers fight epinephrine binding.
**Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors** target the angiotensin-aldosterone system to decrease BP.

**Antiplatelet agents** prevent further platelet buildup. Aspirin is one of these.
**Anticoagulant drugs** prevent coagulation.
**Fibrinolytic agents** can dissolve clots.

**Xanthines** relax the bronchioles and simulates cardiac muscles.
