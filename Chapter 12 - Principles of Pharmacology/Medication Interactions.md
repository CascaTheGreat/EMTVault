Anything can affect meds.

**Iatrogenic responses** are inadvertently caused for the patient by the treatment.

After sensitized to something, reexposure cause **hypersensitivity**. Delayed reaction is **serum sickness**.
When the reaction is patient specific, this is **idiosyncrasy**, like a seizure after nitro.

You can build **tolerance** to a med, or **cross-tolerance** to a class of meds. Conditions refusing treatment are **refractory**.

**Summation effect** is when two drugs work together, **synergism** is when drugs do something greater that the sum, **potentiation** is when one enhances another. Direct interaction is **interference**.
