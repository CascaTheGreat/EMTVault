**Gestation** is the process of fetal development. A fertilized egg or **zygote** moves to the uterus, dividing and implanting when the **embryo** contains around 32 cells. The inner cells become the embryo, the outer cells become the placenta. After 10 weeks, it is referred to as a **fetus**. The **umbilical cord** connects the placenta to the fetus. The **ductus arteriosus** connect the pulmonary artery and aorta. The **foramen ovale** connects the right and left atria.

The **amniotic sac** fills with **amniotic fluid** to protect and cushion the fetus. A **premature rupture of membranes** puts the fetus at risk for complications. The **gestational period** is the time for an infant to develop in utero. Major organ systems start developing in the **embryonic period**.
