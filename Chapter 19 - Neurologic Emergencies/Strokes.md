Also a **cerebrovascular accident**, a condition induced by interrupted blood supply to parts of the brain. Primarily occurs in PT 65+ y/o. 

When cells die from hypoperfusion, they become **infarcted cells** (basically fucked). It can take several hours to get to this point though. If cells keep getting a little oxygen, they may become **ischemic cells** that are alive but not working right, may cause disability. Fatality is based on timing, see chart in [[Neurologic Pathophysiology]].

Blood interruption can be caused by the locally developing **thrombus** in a cerebral artery, **arterial rupture**, or the translocated **cerebral embolism**.

Strokes are either **hemorrhagic** (abt 13%, caused by arterial rupture), or **ischemic** (87%, caused by embolism or thrombus).

### Ischemic Stroke
Caused by vessel blockage, only affects tissue beyond the block. Usually caused by [[Cardiovascular Pathophysiology|atherosclerosis]]. Symptoms vary heavily based on clot location, up to potential complete paralysis. This is where we see unilateral movement loss.

### Hemorrhagic Stroke
When bleeding occurs into the brain, usually after arterial rupture and then clotting. While bleeding continues, ICP onsets and brain tissue compresses, preventing oxygenation. Chronic hypertension weakens vessels, increasing risk of this. 
Aneurysms weaken the arterial wall, posing greater risk of stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke due to ruptured aneurysms often presents with incredible headache, followed by ICP and decreased LOC. 
In young, healthy patients, this is likely a saccular aneurysm. Resembles a small sac off the artery, rupturing into the subarachnoid and making a subarachnoid hemorrhage, can be fixed with surgery.

With sufficient pressure on the brain, it may be forced through the foramen magnum in **herniation**, slowing HR and causing weird vitals.

### Transient Ischemic Attack
An ischemic stroke where the body kills the clot, restoring blood flow and alleviating symptoms. Labeled a **TIA** if symptoms go away in 24 hrs. Strongly recommend a doctor's visit.

### Symptoms
 - Facial Droop
 - Unilateral weakness or numbness
 - Ataxia
 - Dysphagia
 - Unilateral vision loss, blurred or double vision
 - Slurred Speech (or general **dysarthria**)
 - Aphasia

Hypoglycemia, [[Seizures|postictal state]], and sub/epidural bleeding can mimic stroke.
