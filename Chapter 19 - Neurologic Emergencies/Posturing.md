Two main postures note painful stimulation and indicate big ICP.

**Decorticate posturing** is where arms curl to the chest, toes point and wrists flex. May be damage below the hemispheres.

**Decerebrate posturing** has pointed toes, extended arms and pronation. This one is worse and say the damage is near the brainstem.
