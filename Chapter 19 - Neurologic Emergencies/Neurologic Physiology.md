Nerve cells or **neurons** are comprised of three main parts: body, axon, and dendrites. The **axon** carries signals to other cells, and often is wrapped in insulating **myelin** to improve transmission efficiency, speed and prevent shorts.

Neurons interact at **synapses**, where chemical transmitters hop a small gap to get to another cell. These **neurotransmitters** include chemicals like dopamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. After jumping off the axon at the synapse, they bind to the dendrite and repeat.
