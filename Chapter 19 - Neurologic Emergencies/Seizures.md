Caused by erratic neuron firing, can present with spasms, increased secretion, diaphoresis, and cyanosis. Can be limited to tremors in one extremity, a metallic taste, or full movement and loss of consciousness. PT may or may not be aware of it occurring.

Can be caused by head trauma, a brain tumor, metabolic issues, genetic factors, scar tissue from strokes, or other factors.

### Generalized seizures
Caused by abnormal electrical discharge from both hemispheres, typically makes PT unresponsive with general seizing (called a motor seizure if present).

In **generalized tonic-clonic seizures**, almost all muscles twitch or jerk at once. Also presents with tachycardia, hyperventilation, sweating, salivation. Usually follows this pattern, though some skips happen:
1. Aura (noise, twitch, taste, colors)
2. Loss of response
3. Tonic phase (rigidity)
4. Hypertonic phase (arch back and rigid)
5. Clonic (spasming, chaotic and disorganized)
6. Postseizure (muscle relax, eyes may be rolled back or twitching)
7. Postictal phase (reset, aphasia, AMS, tired, incontinent, gradually fades.)
Apneic periods can occur, only intervene if they last 30+ seconds.

**Pseudoseizures** mimic this, but are psychiatric. Often triggered by emotional event, stress, light or pain. Movement is more organized.

**Absence seizures** present with little to no movement, just period without any PT response. Often sudden, like they just freeze - no postictal period or confusion.

### Focal Seizures
Start in one area of the brain, can be motor or not. PT stays responsive, feels numb, weak, or dizzy. Some stay unilateral, PT usually doesn't remember the episode.

### Status Epilepticus
Seizure that 4-5+ minutes or repeat episodes where responsiveness doesn't return. Time frame is made up and contested though, check local protocols. Life threatening, mortality rate of 70%.

### Causes
Disorders like epilepsy are congenital, others are caused by fevers, structural problems, or metabolic problems. Epileptic seizures can be controlled by meds (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, gabapentin), most seizures are result of not taking meds.
**Febrile seizures** are caused

Postictal state by present with **hemiparesis**, unilateral weakness mimicking [[Strokes|a stroke]].

### Treatment
Keep the airway patent, suction if possible, consider airway intervention, place in recovery to keep secretions from the airway. Don't put shit in their mouth. **Trismus** or teeth clench needs sedation, call paramedics early if PT has a difficult airway. Place PT paralyzed side down and padded, elevating head 6 in.
