Normal temp is 98.6 degrees. Hyperthermia is typically 101 degrees or higher. Exposure can cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke. untreated **heat exhaustion** may progress to heatstroke, which can be fatal.

**Heat cramps** are painful muscle spasms after vigorous exercise, probably due to electrolyte loss from sweating.

**Heat exhaustion** is hypovolemia from sweating. Presents with cold, clammy skin, thirst, dizziness, weak, or faint with nausea. Vitals will be normal, though pulse is rapid and bp might be low. Temp normal to slightly elevated. May have orthostatic hypotension.

**Heatstroke** is the least common heat illness, but most serious. Organ damage occurs in the brain, liver, and kidneys. Skin is usually hot, dry, and flushed (not always in early onset). Temp can get up to 106, raising as LOC drops. Seizure activity is possible, pt will quickly be unresponsive. Respiratory rate increases, pulse weakens and bp falls.

### Treatment
Remove the pt from the heat, loosen tight clothing, give oxygen if indicated. Replace fluids, ideally by mouth (plain water is best). If cramping, rest muscles. Cool with water spray/mist and fanning.

For heat exhaustion, do the above and apply ice packs to the trunk of the body. Use ice bath if available, try to put pt supine. Transport in recovery if emesis is possible, encourage to consume up to 1L of water or until nausea develops. If not alert, give 20ml/kg saline.

For heatstroke, get pt to the ambulance, max out ac, remove pt clothing. Give oxygen and consider paramedic intervention. Do ice bath if possible, and if only doable on scene, cool to 101-102 degrees. Cover with wet towels/sheets or spray with water, give 20ml/kg isotonic crystalloid. Transport and notify.
