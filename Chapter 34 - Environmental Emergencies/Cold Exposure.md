Heat travels from warm to cold, so the body tends to lose heat to the environment.
- Conduction is direct transfer by contact
- Convection is temperature transfer by air
- Evaporation is the conversion of liquid to gas
- Radiation is the loss through radiant energy, like the heat a fire gives off
- Respiration causes heat loss as warm air is exhaled and cold air inhaled.

The rate of heat loss is controlled by altering heat production, changing the environment, or wearing different clothing.

**Hypothermia** is low temperature, is a temp < 95 degrees. Body constricts vessels and shivers to maintain heat. Can occur when temperatures are above freezing.

Temperature of 95-93 has withdrawn mental status and rapid breathing, 92-89 has loss of coordination and lethargy/confusion, 88-80 is coma, dysrhythmias and slow resperations, unresponsive, <80 is apparent death.

**!!Don't assume a cold and pulseless patient is dead!!** They aren't dead until they're warm and dead.

Local cold injuries shows with **frostnip**, chilblains or **immersion foot**. A frozen part has frostbite - frostnip can be reversed, frostbite can't. Frostbite is a hard, waxy feeling tissue.
