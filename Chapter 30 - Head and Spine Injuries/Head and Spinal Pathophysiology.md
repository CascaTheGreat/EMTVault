**Closed head injuries** are most common and are usually caused by blunt trauma. Such injuries are complicated by **ICP**. In an **open head injury**, dura matter and cranial contents are penetrated and exposed.

Skull fracture can present with ecchymosis under the eyes (**racoon eyes**) or behind the ear (**Battle sign**). Indicates basal skull fracture.

**Linear skull fractures** are most skull fractures. If brain uninjured and no lacerations, is not life-threatening.

**Depressed skull fractures** are trauma from blunt object. Bone fragments may get into the brain, may lacerate scalp.

**Basilar skull fracture** is high-energy trauma, leaks CSF, often through the ear. Creates meningitis risk.

**Traumatic brain injuries** are either a primary TBI or secondary TBI. Primary is direct injury from impact, secondary is consequence of things like cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and heightened ICP.

**Intercranial pressure** is the pressure in the cranial vault, should be 5-15 mm Hg. **Cerebral perfusion pressure** is the blood flow pressure through the brain, is **MAP**-ICP. Body responds to decreased CPP by increasing MAP in **autoregulation**.

**Focal brain injuries** is specific, grossly observable injury (can be seen on CT scan). Examples include a **cerebral contusion**, where tissue is bruised, or a **concussion** which doesn't actually physically damage the brain.

An **epidural hematoma** is blood pooled between the skull and dura mater.
