The ideal procedure to move a patient from the ground to a backboard is a **four-person log roll**. Alternatively, use scoop stretchers to minimize pt movement.

To use vacuum stretcher, either log roll or scoop stretcher pt onto the stretcher while keeping the air intake open. Conform the stretcher to the head, secure chest, hips and legs.

If seated, use a short backboard and attach it to a long backboard.
