In [[Pathophysiology]], pH must remain balanced to maintain homeostasis.

This affects almost every complaint - hyperventilation causes alkalosis, diabetic ketoacidosis causes acidosis (duh). If extracellular pH is low, the extracellular fluid will signal the cell to bring in H+ ions and shift cations (potassium and calcium) into the interstitial fluid.

Disturbances of this balance are associated with potassium imbalance. Kidneys excrete H+ and bring in K+ in acidosis, and do the opposite in alkalosis. Potassium imbalance often shows as a disturbance in excitable tissue, usually the heart. Calcium also leaves the cells making hypersensitive neurons.

These pH imbalances have four big categories of presentation: **respiratory acidosis**, **respiratory alkalosis**, **metabolic acidosis**, and **metabolic alkalosis**. Bicarbonate fluctuations cause the metabolic ones, respiratory disorders cause respiratory issues (wow no way). When the [buffers](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Chapter%207%20-%20Anatomy%20and%20Physiology%2FAcid-Base%20Balance%20(anatomy)) can't fix the problem, another presentation might happen to oppose it, so treat both.

## Respiratory Acidosis
Decreased resp = increased CO2 and H2CO3, lowering pH. Always relates to hypoventilation, typically triggers renal buffer. Can quickly devolve into life threat if respirations not restored or decrease. Decreased pH puts [[Electrolyte Imbalances#Potassium|potassium]] into the blood and causes [[Electrolyte Imbalances#Calcium|hypercalcemia]]. Symptoms include vasodilation, headache, CNS depression, warm skin, and bradypnea. COPD leads to respiratory acidosis with slow onset, allowing the renal system to fight it. 

## Respiratory Alkalosis
Opposite of acidosis, hyperventilation drops the amount of CO2 and raises the pH. The renal system retains H+ ions and they move towards the extracellular fluid, calcium moves to the intracellular fluid, causing muscles contractions and often **carpopedal spasms** (contorted position of fingers and toes flexing). Often caused by drug overdose (aspirin), fever, or too much BVM. Causes lowered consciousness, spasms, AMS, vertigo, paresthesia, and nausea.

## Metabolic Acidosis
Caused by excess carbonic acid, which breaks down into hydrogen and bicarbonate. Any non-respiratory acidosis is metabolic. Diabetic ketoacidosis patients often experience Kussmaul respirations to hyperventilate shed CO2. Can be caused by lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose (150mg/kg), alcohol ketoacidosis, or CO poisoning. Clinical presentation is similar to respiratory acidosis, but with tachypnea and potential dysrhythmias.

## Metabolic Alkalosis
Often occurs with increased urine output or lowered GI acid levels, rarely acute. Could be caused by excessive vomiting, water intake, alkaline substance intake like antacids, or nasogastric suctioning. Presents as confusion, bradypnea, hypotension, and cramps.
