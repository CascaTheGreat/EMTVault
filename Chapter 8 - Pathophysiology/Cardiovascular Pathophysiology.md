Heart-related chest pain is usually due to **ischemia**, where blood flow is decreased to the heart.

**Atherosclerosis** is the buildup of cholesterol in blood vessels, causing occlusions. The inner diameter of the artery is the **lumen**.

**Thromboembolism** is a clot that blocks blood flow. If it occurs in a coronary artery, this is an **acute myocardial infarction**. **Acute coronary syndrome** are the symptoms present in myocardial ischemia (decreased heart blood flow). Could be angina pectoris or AMI. 

**Angina** has no rhythm change, often when increased stress that dissipates when stress stops.  Pain is crushing, radiates to back, arms, or jaw, but doesn't mean damage is occurring. Rarely lasts more than 15 minutes, presents w nausea, sweating, dyspnea. 

AMI starts gradual, builds to severe, preceded by nausea, weakness, sweating and indigestion.

**Aortic aneurysms** are weaknesses in the aorta walls, potentially causing rupture. Presents as tearing, burning sensation with rapid onset, often in the back and radiating forward.

**Dissecting aneurysms** occur when inner aorta layers separate and blood flows between them. May have different pressures between arms.
