In [[Pathophysiology]], **Hypoperfusion** is when the body doesn't have enough oxygen enriched blood getting everywhere. Body responds by releasing [[Endocrine System|catecholamines]], increasing cardiac contraction, pulse, and inducing vasoconstriction. Antidiuretics are released, retaining salt and water and peripheral constriction. Usually increases stroke volume and rate.
If stress is maintained, the body decompensates, cyanosis starts, BP drops, edema starts, and AMS.
[[Chapter 8 - Pathophysiology/Shock]] is the state of hypoperfusion as cells go anaerobic, produce lactic acid, make less energy, and glucose impairment raises sugar levels.
