In [[Pathophysiology]], the immune system has three lines of defense - anatomic barriers, inflammatory response, and immune response.

## Anatomic Barriers
Physical blocks like the skin, nose hairs, and stomach acid that kill or prevent invasion.

## Immune Response
The reaction to foreign substance invasion, set off by tumors, splinters, or pathogens. In encapsulated bacteria, the cell activates the complement system, activating chemotaxins that call in WBCs, ending by forming the membrane attack complex that eats the bacteria's capsule. **Helper T cells**, cytokine release and form antibodies.
**Natural immunity** is also native immunity.
**Acquired immunity** is activated up when a virus is reencountered, body recognizes the antigen and releases antibodies that bind to immune cells and kill antigens. **Immunogens** are antigens that create an immune response. A **hapten** wouldn't normally start immune response, but does with an antigen.

**Humoral immunity** is where B-cell lymphocytes make immunoglobulins (specific antibodies).
**B Lymphocytes** leading theory is they make antibodies for only one specific antigen and proliferate on activation. They are activated by helper T cells.
**Immunoglobulins** are y-shaped proteins with a Fc and two Fab regions. The Fab binds to antigens, the Fc determines the class of antibody.

**Cell-mediated immunity** is the formation of lymphocytes to attack foreign material. This is how organs are rejected. T-cell lymphocytes find antigens and secret cytokines (call other cells) or become cytotoxic and kill cells. 
1. Killer T cells are cytotoxic and kill tissue
2. Helper T cells activate immune cells
3. Suppressor T cell suppress lymphocytes to save good tissue.
4. Memory T cells remember the reaction
5. Lymphokine producers damage infected cells.
Macrophages eat pathogens, digest, and releases antigens to T cells.

## Inflammatory Response
Pain swelling, redness, heat, works independent of immune but often at same time.
**Acute inflammation** involves arterial constriction and dilation, pooling fluid into the capillaries. Immune cells respond, chemical mediators like histamines,  interleukins and tumor necrosis factor activate most of the response. 
**Mast cells** degranulate in inflammation, releasing tons of stuff. One of them is **Vasoactive amines**, notably histamines and serotonin. Also synthesize **leukotrienes**(hormone) which mediate inflammation, some are bronchoconstrictors. Also makes **prostaglandins**  that are messengers in reproduction, inflammatory response, and are inhibited by Aspirin.

**Plasma protein systems** modulate the inflammatory process. Covers the complement system, coagulation, and kinin systems.

Cells try to get **polymorphonuclear neutrophils**  to needed tissue, leukocytes move to sides of blood vessels in intravascular and leave it in extravascular.
1. Margination
2. Activation
3. Adhesion
4. Transmigration
5. Chemotaxis
**Cytokines** are made by cells to alter cellular function. **Interleukins** attract WBCs. **Interferon** is a protein that tells other cells to fight infection. **Lymphokines** stimulate WBCs.

**Angiogenesis** is the growth of new blood vessels.
