In [[Pathophysiology]], **cellular injury** is the manifestation of damage to [[The Cell]]. Various processes can cause cellular injury, like hypoxia, ischemia, infections or mechanical damage. These manifestations typically happen on microscopic levels, distorting cell shapes and disrupting function. Intracellular acidosis is an example of such functional injury.

**Hypoxic Injury** is common and results from decreased oxygen saturation in the body. **Free radicals** are one of the first mediators in hypoxia and are missing a valence electron, pulling one from other cells and disrupting surrounding tissue.

**Chemical Injury** is caused by poisoning, often cyanide and pesticides. Carbon monoxide poising is chemical, but prevents oxygen saturation. Inebriation is chemical injury induced by ethanol. 7.5g of Tylenol in one dose can induce fatal chemical injury.

**Infectious Injury** is caused by pathogenic invasion, either via direct cell attacks or through the inflammatory response. **Virulence** is the disease-inducing ability of a pathogen. **Bacteria** often have capsules to prevent phagocyte destruction - TB doesn't though. Fevers are caused by **pyrogens** released by WBCs. **Viruses** have a core of genetic info surrounded by the capsid. 

**Immunologic Injury** is caused during the **inflammatory response.** When the immune system activates, vessels dilate, tissue inflames, and fever can occur. The resulting increases in WBCs is **leukocytosis**. Cellular membranes may be injured in this process, leaking potassium and swelling it, potentially leading to cell death.

**Genetic Factors**-chromosomal disorders and sometime obesity can damage cells by messing up DNA.

**Nutritional imbalance** is eating bad and not getting vitamins, messing with cell nutrition.

**Physical Agents** like heat, cold and radiation, can mess with cells.

**Apoptosis** is the programmed death of a cell, induced by the activation of genes that make caspases proteins. This kills the cell and recycles its parts. Can be activated early, like in heart failure or hepatitis. Needed to prevent cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.
