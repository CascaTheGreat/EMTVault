In [[Pathophysiology]], **shock** is the result of [[Hypoperfusion]]. **Central shock** is cardiogenic or obstructive, **peripheral shock** is hypovolemic or distributive.

## Central Shock
### Cardiogenic Shock
The result of inadequate heart performance, often when 40% of the myocardium goes offline. MI is the biggest cause.

### Obstructive Shock
Occurring when there is a blockage, **pericardial tamponade** is a common one due to filling of pericardial sac. Other causes are tension pneumo, pulmonary embolus.

## Peripheral Shock
### Hypovolemic Shock
Caused by excessive fluid loss, exogenous if the fluids get out, endogenous if they are lost inside the body.

### Distributive Shock
Caused by widespread dilation of small arterioles and/or venules. Blood pools in vascular beds and stops circulating.
**Anaphylactic shock** occurs with histamine release, shows as wheezing and urticaria, vasodilation leaks flood and makes intravascular hypovolemia.
**Septic shock** is widespread (usually bacterial) infection. If immune system overwhelmed, starts vasodilation and decreased cardiac output.
**Neurogenic shock** is usually spinal cord injury, losing nervous system tone and vasodilation
