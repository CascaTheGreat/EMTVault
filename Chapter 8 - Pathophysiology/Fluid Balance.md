In [[Pathophysiology]], **Homeostasis** is the balance of fluids, electrolytes, and pH. 

The body is between 50% to 70% water by weight. Newborns may be up to 80% water. Body fluid has two components: **intracellular and extracellular fluid**. ICF is 40-45% of the weight and 75% of all fluid. ECF is 15-20% of body weight. **Intravascular fluid** or **plasma** is the fluid of blood, and is 4.5% of the body weight. **Interstitial fluid** is located between cells and is about 10.5% of the weight.

Dehydration alters homeostasis, and can be caused by lack of intake or excessive output. Healthy adults need 30% of total fluid loss to show symptoms of dehydration, while small kids only need to lose 10-15%.

**Edema** is swelling caused by excessive fluid trapped in the tissues, and can be caused by any number of things. A common one is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, which could be arteriolar dilation (allergies), venous obstruction, CHF, pregnancy, heat stress. 
Edema can also be caused decreased plasma protein production or loss of plasma proteins from kidney disease and burns. 
Lymphatic vessel obstruction can also cause edema. As less interstitial fluids are taken in by the lymphatic system, they pool with the cells, so severed edema can develop over time.
Clinical manifestations may be local or generalized and it can have a stupid number of causes. You should listen to lungs and look for pedal edema, sacral edema, and JVD.

**Isotonic fluid deficit** is a decrease in extracellular fluid with equitable sodium and water loss. Happens a lot, often from sweating. Isotonic increase can be due to kidney or heart failure. In dehydration, orthostatic hypotension and decreased urine output (**oliguria**) tend to happen. Excessive sodium can cause delirium and coma. This water-sodium relationship is tonicity.
