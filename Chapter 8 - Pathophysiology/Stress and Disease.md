In [[Pathophysiology]], stress is the response for a number of external stimuli. The typical response is appropriate, but can cause addiction, MI, stroke or depression of unchecked.

## General Adaptation Syndrome
**GAS** is a three-stage reaction to stress.

**Alarm** is the first stage, where the body releases [[Endocrine System|catecholamines]] that circulate. Adrenaline and norepinephrine bind to receptors to activate sympathetic nervous system. Alpha activation does vasoconstriction, beta does heart rate and contraction strength. Also ups resp rate, drops blood flow to skin.

**Resistance or Adaptation** is stage two, where glucose increases and BP maintained through glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.

**Exhaustion** is stage three, after long stress the adrenal glands deplete, glucose drops, fatigue, illness, collapse, and potential MI.

The **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis** controls the stress reaction via hormone release. High cortisol suppresses the immune system and serotonin, depressing the body.
