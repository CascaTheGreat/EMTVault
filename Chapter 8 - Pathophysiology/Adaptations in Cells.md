In [[Pathophysiology]], when exposed to adverse conditions, cells adapt to guard against injury, sometimes changing permanently.

**Atrophy** is a decrease in cell size due to missing fundamental pieces missing. The size decreases to compensate for the lack of nutrients or use - immobilized limbs lose muscle mass with this.

**Hypertrophy** is an increase in cell size due to excess use or stress. The left ventricle may hypertrophy as a result of hypertension.

**Hyperplasia** is an increase in the number of cell, often making the organ bigger. A callus is a hyperplasia of the epidermis.

**Dysplasia** is a change in size, shape, or cell organization. This typically happens in cells that have had changes due to chronic irritation or inflammation.

**Metaplasia** is reversible, and when one cell type gets replaced by another.
