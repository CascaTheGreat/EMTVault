In [[Pathophysiology]], electrolytes must remain balanced to maintain homeostasis.
## Sodium
Sodium is mainly in the [[Blood]] and extracellular fluid, and regulates fluid balance, volume, and blood pressure by affecting membrane permeability by water. Normal range is **135 to 145 mEq/L^3**. Hypertonic fluid deficict occurs with relative water loss. **Hypernatremia** is a sodium level of 146 or higher. A hypotonic fluid deficit occurs with relative water excess. **Hyponatremia** is sodium of 134 or less.
These can be cause by sweating, GI losses, and inappropriate IV fluid use. 

## Potassium
The major intracellular cation is crucial to cellular functions like neuromuscular control, regulating all muscle types, regulating pH, facilitating enzyme reactions, and intracellular osmolarity. Normal potassium ranges from **3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L^3**. **Hypokalemia** is below 3.5, caused by bad intake, decreased shift into cells from insulin or epinephrine or alkalosis, renal potassium loss or vomiting. Mild to moderate causes cramps, weakness, and fatigues. **Hyperkalemia** is elevated potassium, caused by decreased excretion, burns, or excessive intake. Can cause weakness and rarely paralysis.

## Calcium
98% of Ca+2 is found in the bones and teeth. Calcium enters through the GI, absorbed in the intestine with vitamin D's help, which is produced in part by sunlight exposure. It is stored in bones and excreted by kidneys. Range is **8.6 to 10.2 mg/dL^3**. **Hypocalcemia** could be caused by sepsis, alcoholism, endocrine disease, or bad intake. It can cause skeletal muscle spasm, cramps, laryngospasm, seizure, and paresthesia. **Hypercalcemia** can be caused by neoplasms (cancers), endocrine disorders, excessive antacid intake.

## Phosphate
PO is an intracellular anion is used in tons of body functions. **Hypophosphatemia** is a decrease in phosphate level, can be caused by starvation, antacids with aluminum, diuretics or alcoholism, other electrolyte abnormalities, diabetic ketoacidosis, or oral contraceptives. Can cause hyoptension, AMS, weakness, and seizures or blood disorders in severe cases. **Hyperphosphatemia** can be caused by excess vitamin D, laxatives, chemo, or renal failure. Normal range is **2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL^3**

## Magnesium
Half in bones, 49% in cells, rest extracellular fluid. Normal range is **1.6 to 2.6 mEq/L^3**. **Hypomagnesia** can be caused by diabetes, pregnancy, bad intake or laxative abuse, causes CNS irritability (tremors and jerking), hypertension, tachycardia, AMS. **Hypermagnesia** is usually caused by messed up kidneys. Causes weakness, bad reflexes, AMS, respiratory muscle paralysis and cardiac arrest are possible.
