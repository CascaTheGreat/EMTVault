Also **hypoperfusion**.

**Cardiac output** is the volume the heart can pump per minute, affected by **myocardial contractility**, **preload**(precontraction pressure as blood comes to the heart), and **afterload**(force against which the heart pumps).

The three main causes are pump failure(MI, embolisms), low volume(trauma, excessive vomiting), poor vessel function(sepsis, OD, anaphylaxis).

Major types include:
- [[Cardiogenic Shock]]
- [[Distributive Shock]]
- [[Obstructive Shock]]
- Hypovolemic Shock
	- Nonhemorrhagic keeps fluid loss inside (burns, dehydration, anaphylaxis), concerns plasma or electrolytes
	- Hemorrhagic is blood.
For hypovolemic, establish an 18-gauge IV and start fluids.
