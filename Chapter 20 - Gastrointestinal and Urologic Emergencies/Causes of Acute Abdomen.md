## Hemorrhagic causes

### GI Hemorrhage
More a symptom than disease itself, times and cause can vary.

| organ | causes | location | substance |
|----|----|----|----|
| Esophagus | Cancer, varices, inflammation | Upper GI | Melena, hematemesis |
| Stomach | Ulcers, cancer, gastritis | Upper GI | Melena, hematemesis |
| Small Intestine | Duodenal ulcer, cancer | Upper or Lower GI | Melena, hematemesis |
| Large Intestine | Infection, ulcerative colitis, polyps, colon cancer | Lower GI | Hematochezia |
| Rectum | Hemorrhoids | Lower GI | Hematochezia, gross bleeding |
Esophageal bleed can also be a Mallory-Weiss tear, induced by excessive retching. **Hematemesis** is red or coffee ground, upper also may be dark, tarry **melena**. Lower GI is usually bright red.

### Esophagitis
Inflammation of the esophagus, caused by infection, GERD, or some therapies. Presents w heartburn or choking.

### GERD
**Gastroesophageal reflux disease** is where stomach acid moves superior, burning the esophagus. Often shows as heartburn.

### Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastritis
Abrasions of the stomach or small intestine called **ulcers** form in response to high acidity. PUD sees the protective mucus membrane eaten away and ulcers forming. Gastritis is the same imbalance where inflammation has occurred, but no ulcers.

### Mallory-Weiss Tear
Tear in the junction of esophagus and stomach, causing bad bleeds. Risks include alcoholism and EDs, sudden onset. **Boerhaave syndrome** is a longitudinal tear that lets blood and air into the mediastinum. Often after large meal w/ alcohol, and usually in men.

### Esophageal Varices
Occurs when vessels around esophagus raise in pressure, if blood cannot easily flow through liver it builds up and builds pressure on vessels that can leak into the esophagus. Often caused by alcoholism. Shows as liver disease first, then GI bleed - liver issues last several months, rupture is sudden.

### Hemorrhoids
Swelling of vessels around the rectum, common w/ half the population having one by 50. Cause bright blood in defecation called **hematochezia**.

## Nonhemorrhagic Conditions
### Gallstones
Stones formed in the gallbladder that prevent output, can inflame the organ causing **cholecystitis**. Sever pain in right upper or midabdominal that can refer to RUP back, shoulder, or flank. Symptoms usually at night and abt 30 mins after fatty meal consumption.

### Pancreatitis
Inflammation of the pancreas. Pain in LUQ and RUQ, often radiates to back. Sepsis or hemorrhage can occur.

### Appendicitis
Starts and generalized and dull, then localizes to RLQ. Also nausea, emesis, anorexia, fever, chills. Classic symptom is **rebound tenderness** (not always in pregnant women).

### Gastroenteritis
Group of conditions that are mostly infection based, causing diarrhea, nausea, and emesis. Caused by bacteria and viruses, typically through contaminated food or water. Can start several hours to days after exposure, lasts 2-3 days or several weeks. Could also be caused by chemo, adverse med reaction, or toxic exposure. Large dumping diarrhea or frequent small stools.

### Diverticulitis
Bacteria trapped in diverticula (outcroppings) in the intestine. Main symptom is abdominal pain localizes to LLQ.
