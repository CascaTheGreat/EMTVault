In [[Pathophysiology]], this studies the digestive system.

**Acute abdomen** is sudden onset pain indicating **peritoneum** irritation (the abdominal cavity lining membrane). This (**peritonitis**) condition could be penetrating wound, infections, blunt injury, or diseases - often presents with tenderness and distension.

Parietal peritoneum is abt as sensitive as the abdominal skin, visceral is less so and can't localize as easy. Visceral is stimulated when distension or contraction activates stretch receptors, making severe, colic pain.
**Visceral pain** is typically urologic problems can can be hard to locate, sometimes referred to a distant point. (gallbladder inflammation goes to right shoulder)

Peritonitis (peritoneum inflammation) causes **ileus** (paralyzed muscles that do peristalsis). Stomach can only be emptied with **emesis**, which often occurs. Can cause hypovolemia, often presents like shock with worsening symptoms. Pts with **diverticulitis** or **cholecystitis** may have big fever, though **appendicitis** usually may have normal temp.

These conditions may cause **urinary retention**, where the bladder's ability to empty is restricted.
