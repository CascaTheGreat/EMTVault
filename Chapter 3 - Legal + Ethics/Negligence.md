**Negligence** is the failure to meet a reasonable [[Standard of Care]]. **Gross negligence** is a willful disregard for this standard.

There are three categories of negligence:
1. Malfeasance
	- When you perform an act outside of your [[Scope Of Practice]]
2. Misfeasance
	- When you improperly perform an act within your scope
3. Nonfeasance
	- When you fail to perform an act you are expected to perform

Negligence so obvious it doesn't require extensive proof is **res ipsa loquitur**.
Negligence in clear violation of your scope is **negligence per se**.

## In Court
In a [[Civil Suit]], the plaintiff must prove four things:
1. [Duty](#Duty)
2. [Breach of duty](#Breach of Duty)
4. [Damages](#Damages)
5. [Proximate Cause](#Proximate Cause)

## Duty
Duty is the obligation to provide care that meets the [[Standard of Care]]. Bystanders have no legal duty to act. When dispatched to or witnessing an emergency situation while on duty, you have a duty to act. When treatment is started, you have a [duty to act](Abandonment). If you choose to intervene, you must continue to provide care until someone of equal or higher training assumes care.

## Breach of Duty
Occurs when someone with a duty to act fails to meet the standard of care.

## Damages
The patient is physically or mentally harmed in a noticeable manner.

## Proximate Cause
The breach of duty cause the damages. *Would the damages have occurred but for the negligent act?*
