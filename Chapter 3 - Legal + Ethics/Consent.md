Consent is required from every [[Competent]] adult. Anyone receiving care must first give consent for treatment. A patient can consent to only parts of care and can withdraw consent at any time. Patients have [[Patient Autonomy]].

## Expressed Consent
**Expressed consent** occurs when competent patients approve of medical treatment. Though it may be verbal or nonverbal, nonverbal should really only be used in patients who cannot verbalize consent. Patients can give consent in advance with an [[Advance Directive]] or a [[DNR]].

## Informed Consent
An extension of [[#Expressed Consent]] where a patient is fully informed of the situation. Obtain informed consent from any competent patient. Describe the suspected injury, the proposed treatment and ramifications, discuss treatment alternatives if asked, and advise on the consequences of refusing transport.

## Implied Consent
Unresponsive or incompetent individuals who cannot give consent may fall under **implied consent**. In an emergency, the **emergency doctrine** gives a provider permission to act to save a patient without their express consent. An obvious life threat must be present and the EMT must act within scope. Attempt to obtain consent from the patient or next of kin and maintain thorough documentation. When in doubt, obtain medical direction. This is sometimes incorrectly called **involuntary consent**.

## Minors
Minors require a parent to give express consent, though some states allow minors to consent to emergency medical treatment (14 in Alabama). **Emancipated minors** can give valid consent base on certain circumstances (marriage, legal emancipation). **In loco parentis** applies for administrators of schools where parents transfer decision making to them.
In some cases with obvious threats to a minor's life and ability, parental failure to consent to treatment can be considered neglect. Contact medical control and police for advice.
