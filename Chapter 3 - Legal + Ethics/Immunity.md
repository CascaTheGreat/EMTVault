Legal protection from suits and other penalties that might otherwise be accrued under the law. For EMS, this is typically provided by the [[Good Samaritan Laws]]. 

**Governmental immunity** protects EMTs who work for government entities. This type of immunity may prevent a suit from being filed, or will limit the amount that can be awarded in [[Damages]].

Immunity may also be given by the [[Statute of Limitations]].

Partial immunity may be granted to providers who give instructions via radio.
