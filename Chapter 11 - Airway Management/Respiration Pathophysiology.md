In [[Pathophysiology]], respiration delivers oxygen to the body.

Ventilation and perfusion must match, known as **V/Q mismatch**. Depressed ventilation without matched perfusion means the body cant oxygenate. Same if the opposite happens.

Increased CO2 in the blood is **hypercapnia**.

When blood bypasses the alveoli and returns unoxygenated, this is **intrapulmonary shunting**

**Hypoxia** is lack of air in the tissue, **hypoxemia** is lack of arterial blood. Leads to the other. **Anoxia** is after hypoxia and is cells dying.
