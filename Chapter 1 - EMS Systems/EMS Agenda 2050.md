The first **EMS Agenda for the Future** was developed by [[NHTSA]] in the '90s. This document outlined a plan to standardize education for providers nationally. The document was revised in 2019 as the **EMS Agenda 2050** to emphasize patient-centered care.

The EMS Agenda 2050 outlines the following components for a people-centered EMS System:
1. Comprehensive, quality, convenient care
2. Evidence-based clinical care
3. Efficient, well-rounded care
4. Preventive care
5. Comprehensive and easily accessible patient records.

## Access
Dispatchers at a communications center can dispatch first responders and gather necessary information. The communications center is called a **public safety access point**. In an **enhanced 9-1-1** system, these dispatchers can see the address of the caller.
**Emergency medical dispatch** is a system that lets dispatchers provide info to manage medical emergencies before EMS arrival.
