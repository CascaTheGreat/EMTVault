**Devascularization** is blood loss to another part of the body.

Muscles are surrounded by **fascia**, which create compartments. When fluid leaks into these compartments, we can see compartment syndrome.

The release of harmful products in [[Pathophysiology of Soft Tissue Injuries|crush syndrome]] is called **rhabdomyolysis**.

A **swathe** fully wraps around the chest.


**Lateral compression** injuries result from a side impact. The pelvis on this side will rotate around the sacrum, though this rarely causes pelvic hemorrhage.
In anterior-posterior compression pelvic ring disruptions, we often see a **open book pelvic fracture**, where it spread apart and creates the potential for massive blood loss.
**Vertical shear** injuries are when major force hits the pelvis in a vertical direction.
A **straddle fracture** is when the landing hits the perineum.
