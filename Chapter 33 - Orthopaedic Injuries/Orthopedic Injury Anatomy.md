**Hematopoiesis** is the process of generating blood cells.
- **Tendons** connect muscle to bone. 
- **Ligaments** connect bone to bone
- **Cartilage** gives structure and cushioning

A **pathologic facture** occurs when a medical condition makes a bone weak, and a fracture can then happen with little force.
An **indirect injury** is when force in one area injures another. (knee hit in a car crash damaging hips)

### Types of Fractures
 - **Open fracture** is a break where the fracture is exposed through the skin. High infection and blood loss risk.
 - **Closed fracture** contains break and blood loss in the skin, pressure from blood loss will eventually tamponade the flow (sometimes only after 1L of loss)
 **Angulation** of a fracture means the bone is misaligned, a **nondisplaced fracture** is a hairline fracture. A **displaced fracture** has the two bone ends separate in one plain.

- Transverse fractures are straight across the bone.
- Oblique fractures are broken at angle.
- Spiral fractures are caused by a twisting force.
- Comminuted fractures are breaks with more than 2 broken fragments.
- Greenstick fractures pass only partially through the bone, but still cause displacement.
- Incomplete fractures pass only partially through but don't cause displacement.
- Pathologic fractures are breaks of weakened bones.
- Epiphyseal fractures occur in the growth plate.


A **dislocation** is the removal of a bone from its joint. When dislocated, it may undergo **reduction**, where it goes back to normal. Partial dislocation is **subluxation**.

A **sprain** is an injury where ligaments are stretched or torn, mostly at the ankle or knee.

A **strain** is an injury to muscle or tendon, presents with sharp, instant pain and a snapping sound.

A rupture of the Achilles prevents **plantar flexion** and has pain from heel to calf.
