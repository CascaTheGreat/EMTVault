A **hemorrhage** is a discharge of blood from the vessels. Internal bleeding is often severe and uncontrolled, can have any number of traumatic and nontraumatic causes, look for DCAP-BTLS. Bruising indicates internal bleeding, also called a **contusion**, or **ecchymosis**. A **hematoma** is a mass of blood in the soft tissue beneath the skin. **Hematuria** (blood in the urine) may suggest serious internal injury. 
Hematemesis is coffee ground upper GI emesis. Hemoptysis is bright red blood coughed up from the lungs. Melena is lower GI tarry stool, hematochezia is bloody stool, brighter the closer to the rectum.

**Hypovolemic shock** starts with AMS, then altered LOC, tachycardia, weakness or syncope, dull eyes with slow response, slow capillary refill. Decreased BP is a late sign.

**Hemorrhagic shock** is when low volume leads to hypoperfusion and maybe death.
The process of plugging holes and sealing vessels is **hemostasis**.
