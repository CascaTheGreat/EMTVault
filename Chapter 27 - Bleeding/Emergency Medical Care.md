### External Hemorrhage
**Tourniquets** can safely control external hemorrhage without an increase in complications. If needed, get it on fast and don't release until a physician is present. Write TK and the time on their forehead.

**Hemostatic agents** encourage clot formation, either dehydrating the blood or stimulating the natural clotting cascade. **Junctional tourniquets** are used when the hemorrhage is inguinal (groin) or axillary(armpit). Belts around the hip, then inflate a compression device with a pump to restrict flow.
Air splints can control bleeding from massive lacerations or fractures, but not appropriate for an arterial hemorrhage.

**Pneumatic antishock garments** are inflatable devices that cover the legs and abdomen, though they are rarely used now.

**Epistaxis**(nosebleed) is pretty common. Blood seen is a small part, more is swallowed, which may be vomited up. Bleeds are mostly from the septum. Check for hypertension as the cause. May indicate a skull fracture. If so, loosely cover the site with gauze to collect blood and stop contaminants, apply light compression with wrapping around the head.
