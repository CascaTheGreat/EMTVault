The lungs work on negative pressure, so air or fluids preventing the alveoli expanding can decrease respiration. A **hemothorax** is when blood accumulates in this pleural space. **Atelectasis** is alveolar collapse that prevents its use for respiration.
**Hemoptysis** is spitting/coughing up blood, indicating the lung or passages have been damaged.
Loss of peripheral pulse on inspiration is **pulsus paradoxus**, where systolic bp drops 10 mm Hg in inspiration, and **cardiac tamponade**.

**Flail chest** is when a segment of the chest is detached from multiple fractures, often accompanying multiple serious injuries. A **pulmonary contusion** is an injury to the lung tissue that inhibits diffusion.

**Commotio cordis** is when blunt force causes cardiac arrest, often with softballs or baseballs, or in a fight.

**Paper bag syndrome** is when a deep breath just before blunt trauma ruptures the lungs like a paper bag.

**Myocardial rupture** is a perforation of the ventricles, atria, valves, or septums.

**Traumatic aortic disruption** is the rupture of the aorta, often in blunt trauma. 40% die prehospital, less than a third survive 3 days.

When the eyes protrude from the normal position due to jugular vein rupture, this is **exophthalmos**.
