Blunt is energy transmitted without penetrating soft tissue. Penetrating trauma does.

### Blunt Trauma
MVCs and falls are common blunt trauma, suspect internal injuries.
A coup-contrecoup injury is a brain injury in blunt trauma where the skull hits, the body stops, and the brain hits the back of the skull.

Vehicle crashes can often cause damage to the chest, sometimes the pelvis or the head/brain. Pneumothoraxes can happen from chest trauma.
**Developing Problems**

| MOI | Potential Injuries | Signs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Neck trauma | Airway obstruction | Noisy/labored resps, facial swelling |
| Chest wall trauma | Breathing issues, cardiac/pulmonary contusion, pneumo- or hemothorax, broken ribs | Chest pain, shortness of breath, flail chest, penetrating trauma |
| Trauma to chest, abd, or groin | Hidden blood loss | Bruising, redness, abrasions, abd distension, pelvic tenderness |
| Head trauma | Brain injury | AMS, memory issues, combative, speech changes, difficulty moving extremities, severe headache |
| Fall or substantial trauma | Spinal injury | Neck or back pain, difficulty in moving or feeling extremities, loss of distal sensation |

### GSWs
Bullets follow a path called a **trajectory**, giving them an entrance and sometimes exit wound. Cavitation is damage caused by tissue temporarily expanding then closing.
