The **nervous system** is the most complex, comprised of the brain, spinal cord, and thousands of nerves. It controls the [[Respiratory System]] and [[Circulatory System]]. It is divided into the **central nervous system** and **peripheral nervous system**. In the peripheral system, the **somatic system** regulates voluntary actions, while the **autonomic system** regulates involuntary functions. 

## Central Nervous System
### Brain
The **brain** controls the body and divides into the three main divisions of cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. 

The **cerebrum** is gray matter and most of the brain, controlling the opposite side of the body. Within it, the frontal lobe controls skeletal muscles, the parietal lobe handles sensory input, occipital takes in visual stimulus, other parts control hearing, speech, and balance, emotions, and personality.

The **cerebellum** coordinates body movements to control specialized muscular activities.

The **brainstem** is the best-protected and most primitive. In controls almost all life-sustaining bodily functions. It comprises the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. The **reticular activating system** keeps you conscious.

### Spinal Cord
The **spine** is an extension of the brainstem that contains nerve fibers. It transmits signals from the brain to the rest of the body.

### Meninges
The CNS is enclosed by three membranes known as the meninges. The toughest, outer membrane is the **dura mater**, the second is the **arachnoid**, and the innermost that directly meets the brain or spine is the **pia mater**. Hematomas can be classified based on depth in meninges - epidural when outside the dura, and subdural when below it. Meninges float in CSF which is made within the **choroid plexus**. CSF flows in the subarachnoid space.

### Diencephalon
The **diencephalon** is located between the brain stem and cerebrum, including the thalamus, subthalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus. The **thalamus** processes sensory input and influences mood. Subthalamus does motor function, epithalamus does circadian rhythms and mood, **hypothalamus** control heart rate, digestion, sex development, temperature, emotion, hunger, thirst, and vomiting.

The **limbic system** controls the emotion, motivation, mood, and pain/pleasure. Also plays part in memory.

### Cranial Nerves
**Cranial nerves** are twelve pairs of nerves that arise from the base of the brain. All pairs except the olfactory and optic leave from the brainstem. Some only carry sensory fibers, others only motor, some do both. The **oculomotor nerve** controls eye movement and pupil constriction.

## Peripheral Nervous System
Divided into two portions - somatic and autonomic nervous system. The autonomic system contains the **sympathetic nervous system** (fight or flight) and **parasympathetic nervous system** (rest and digest). The two types of nerves here are **sensory** and **motor**.

**Sensory nerves** take information in and return it to the CNS, **motor nerves** send electrical impulses to stimulate skeletal muscles. **Spinal reflexes** are powered by cells that connect sensory nerves with motor nerves to enable a rapid response.

## Dermatomes
A **dermatome** is an area of skin that corresponds to certain spinal nerves, impairment can indicate the location of spinal injury.

### Eye
The eyeball is called the **globe**. Inner surface and exposed surface is covered by the **conjunctiva**, kept moist by **lacrimal glands**. Behind the **iris** is the **lens**, which focuses images on the light-sensitive **retina**. It transmits signals on the optic nerve to the brain which processes it.
