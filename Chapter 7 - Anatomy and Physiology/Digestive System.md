Also called the GI system; composed of mouth, GI tract, salivary glands, pharynx, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, and anus. Mostly in the [[Abdomen]]. 

There are two **salivary glands** under the tongue, one in each cheek, and on each lower jaw side.

**Oropharynx** is a tubular structure that goes from the mouth to the trachea.
**Esophagus** propels food to stomach through contraction.
The **stomach** converts food to **chyme**, a semisolid mass of stuff. Sends food in 1-3 hours to duodenum.

The **pancreas** is in the [[Retroperitoneal Cavity]], contains two glands. One makes juice that aids digestion and flows to duodenum, other one (islets of Langerhans) produces insulin.

The **liver** is the largest solid organ and processes poisons created in digestion to be neutralized. Clotting and plasms production factors are made here. Produces bile to aid in fat digestion, stores sugar for use, aids immune response. Easily injured, and all blood for GI tract goes through it, a quarter of cardiac output goes through it every minute.
The liver connects to the intestine with **bile ducts**. The **gallbladder** is attached to it, storing and concentrating bile. These two make the biliary system.

The **small intestine** is the major hollow abdominal organ, absorbing 90% of nutrients and water in digestion. Starts with duodenum (12 in) that gets food from the stomach, mixing with goop from liver and pancreas. 

The **large intestine** (colon) is 5ft long, absorbs last bit of nutrients and forms stool.

The **appendix** is RLQ, often inflamed, don't know what it does.

The **rectum** is the end of the colon, stores feces. It and anus controlled by sphincters that control expulsion from the digestive tract.
