The musculoskeletal system maintains posture, movement, form, and protects internal organs. There are over 600 muscles here, called **skeletal muscle**. it can also be called **striated muscle** or **voluntary muscle**. Movement results from contraction or relaxation of these muscles. 40-50% of body weight is skeletal muscle. Unused muscles **atrophy**, while training promotes **hypertrophy**. 

Most muscles operate in antagonistic pairs. For example, the bicep and triceps work against each other to control the rate of relaxation and contraction.
