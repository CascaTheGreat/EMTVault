**Cellular transport** is how materials enter and exit [[The Cell]]. A number of enzymes, glucose, and electrolytes (ionic conductors in solution) that can freely maneuver the cells. The difference in concentrations on the inside and outside is the **concentration gradient**. 

When solutes move to equalize the concentration gradient, this is **diffusion**. This occurs with oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveoli.

When solutes are removed from fluids like blood in the kidneys, this is **filtration**.

**Facilitated diffusion** is like diffusion, but uses carrier molecules to travel across membranes. Insulin and glucose use such a reaction.

**Active transport** is similar to facilitated diffusion, but uses energy and no carrier molecule to transport across the membrane. **Endocytosis** uses a cell secretion to bring in particles with vesicles. **Pinocytosis** does this with liquid droplets. **Phagocytosis** takes in solids. **Receptor-mediated endocytosis** moves specific particles with proteins extending to the outer surface. **Exocytosis** secretes elements from within the cell.

**Osmosis** is the movement from low to high concentration through a membrane not permeable to the solute. **Osmotic pressure** is the measure of tendency to move across a membrane.

A solution with higher comparative solution is hypertonic, one with lower is hypotonic. An isotonic solution has equal concentrations on either side. Cell shrinking from low concentration is **crenation**, swelling from too much is **lysis**.
