The pelvis is where the lower extremity connects to the body. It contains a ring of bones from the sacrum and coxal bones. Each coxa is made of three fused bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis). There are three joints: two posterior **sacroiliac joints** and the midline **pubic symphysis**. The ilium connects with the sacrum at a sacroiliac joint, and the symphysis is where the two pelvic sides fuse.
