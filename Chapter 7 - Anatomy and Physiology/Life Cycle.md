The cycles is regulated via hormonal stimulation. Most cells divide 40-60 times before death. It follows these steps:
1. Interphase - Cell obtains nutrients to grow and reproduce
2. Cell division - Nucleus division (mitosis)
3. Cytoplasmic division - Cytoplasm divides (cytokinesis)
4. Differentiation - Cell specialization

## Interphase
Cell grows and duplicates organelles and DNA.

## Division
**Meiosis** is the division in sex cells, halving the number of chromosomes in the cell.

**Mitosis** is the division in all other cells (except red blood), involving the division of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Cytokinesis starts in the second phase of mitosis.

## Differentiation
**Differentiation** is the process of cell specialization. **Stem cells** can divide without specialization.

## Cancer
**Neoplasms(tumors)** are tissue masses from abnormal cell division. Malignant tumors begin spreading into surrounding tissues in metastasis, typically as a result of error in DNA division or replication.
