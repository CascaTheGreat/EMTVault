The spine has five section - Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar, Sacrum, and Coccyx.

- Cervical (C1-C7) support head and allows skull rotation.
- Thoracic (T1-12) attaches to ribs and helps hold body erect.
- Lumbar (L1-L5) carry most weight.
- Sacrum are five fused that connect to the pelvis.
- Coccyx are (3-5) usually four fused vertebrae that make the tailbone.

C1 is the **atlas** and supports the head, articulating with the **atlanto-occipital joint**. C2 is the **axis** and is the point of rotation for the head. C3-6 make the cervical curve, and C7 can be seen/felt at the base of the neck. 

The spinal cord carries almost all nerves. The anterior piece of vertebrae is solid bone called the body, while the posterior forms a bony arch, between which the spinal cord resides.
