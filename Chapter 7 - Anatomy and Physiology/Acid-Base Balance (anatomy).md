pH = -log(H+ concentration)
Human body is typically around 7.35 to 7.45, cell death occurs below 6.9 or above 7.8. Buffers push the system to equilibrium by binding to H+ or donating them depending on concentration. Increased pH is acidosis, decrease is alkalosis.

The three main parts of the body's buffer system are the circulating bicarbonate buffer, the respiratory component, and the renal component.

The **circulating bicarbonate buffer** holds and neutralizes excess acid uses bicarbonate ions as a chemical buffer. The **respiratory component** is exhalation, releasing water and CO2. The **renal component** is peeing the acids out, but takes a long time.
