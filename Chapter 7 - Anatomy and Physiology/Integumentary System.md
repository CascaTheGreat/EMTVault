It's a long word for skin. Protects tissue, regulates temp, prevents water loss, and sensory functions. Divided into epidermis and deeper dermis, which lie above fatty, subcutaneous tissue. Varies in thickness by location. 

Epidermis can be separated into base **germinal layer** that refreshes cells and the **stratum corneal layer** which is dead skin. Only the base layer gets blood and contains pigment.

Dermis contains sweat glands, oil glands, hair follicles, and blood and lymph vessels. Also has some sensory nerves. Dermis regulates heat with vasoconstriction/relaxion. Sweat gland cool body, sebaceous glands seal surface cells and waterproof.

Below subcutaneous tissue is the fibrous **deep fascia**, made of tough tissue and protecting the muscle and bones below.

The orifices are not covered by skin, by **mucous membranes** that prevent bacterial infection and secrete lubricating mucus.
