Blood is pumped in the [[Circulatory System]] and is made of 55% plasma and 45% suspended cells. Adult human male bodies contain ~5L of blood (70mL/kg)

**Plasma** is 92% water and 8% proteins and nutrients.

## Red Blood
**Red blood cells** carry oxygen using the protein hemoglobin. **Erythropoiesis** is the creation of these cells - 25 trillion are in a normal adult and 2.5 million are destroyed every second. They have a finite life of 120 days, decompose in the spleen and are recycled, with waste being converted to bilirubin which goes to the liver. An **antigen** stimulates **antibody** production, and exist within the plasma. This creates blood types. Bodies can also contain an **Rh factor** which can complicate pregnancies, especially if antibodies have been developed after exposures.

## White Blood
**White blood cells** primarily fight infection, either producing antibodies or directly attacking invaders. Most can move freely and can leave blood vessels through **diapedesis**. The varieties are named according to microscopic appearance. **Granulocytes** have cytoplasmic granulars, **agranulocytes** don't.

**Neutrophils** are the most common granulocyte and destroy bacteria and foreign matter. **Eosinophils** are granulocytes that stain red and work in allergic response, as well as some parasites. **Basophils** are the least common granulocytes and contain tons of histamines and **heparin** (anti-clotting), playing a role in allergies and inflammation.

**Lymphocytes** are the smallest agranulocytes, coming from bone marrow and migrating through blood to the lymphatic system. **Monocytes** and macrophages are agranulocytes that are part of the first defense in the inflammatory process. They move from blood to tissue in an infection, engulfing microbes and consuming them. Unlike short-lived neutrophils, they mature into macrophages in the tissue.

## Platelets
**Platelets** are cells needed to clot, clumping together and allowing clotting proteins to bind and solidify. **Hemostasis** is the cessation of bleeding. 

To clot: chemicals released from the vessel wall constrict the vessel locally, activate platelets which acts as temp plug. Thromboplastin releases to bring in clotting proteins, forming **thrombin** which makes **fibrin**, binding to platelets and making the final clot.

The fibrinolytic system disrupts established clots by activating the **tissue plasminogen activator**, making **plasmin** which gobbles up fibrin. This isn't 100% effective, but tries to balance clots and bleeds.
