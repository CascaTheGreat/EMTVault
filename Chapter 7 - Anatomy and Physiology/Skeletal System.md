The **skeleton** gives the body form and protects vital organs. Bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments all make up the skeletal system. There are 206 bones in the skeleton.

**Tendons** are a tough cord of dense connective tissue that goes muscle to bone.
**Ligaments** connect bone to bone. Both are made of collagen.
A sprain occurs when bone ends slightly dislocate and the ligaments are stretched or torn. A strain is when a muscle is stretched or torn. Muscle contraction is driven by tendons.
**Cartilage** is lubricated by synovial fluid and connects joints to bones.

**Bones** can be [[Long Bones]](Tib, Fib, Femur), short bones(wrist and ankle), and flat bones(ribs, sternum, shoulder blade).

In adults, in the long bones, bone marrow contains fat and is known as yellow marrow. Bones in the [[Axial Skeleton]] and girdles contain red marrow.

The two main types of bone are **compact bone**, which is mostly solid, and **cancellous bone**, which is made of a lacy network of **trabeculae**.

The skeletal system is divided into the [[Axial Skeleton]] and the [[Appendicular Skeleton]].
