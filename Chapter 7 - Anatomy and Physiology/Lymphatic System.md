The **lymphatic system** passively circulate **lymph**, a thin fluid formed from interstitial fluid. It circulates in thin lymph vessels that follow the [[Circulatory System]] and filtering in **lymph nodes**. Lymph returns to the circulatory system through the **thoracic duct**. Lymphatic capillaries are everywhere except the nervous system, bone marrow, cartilage, epidermis, and cornea. Fluid flows from blood capillaries to tissue, then to lymph capillaries, absorbing excess fluid and returning to central circulation.
