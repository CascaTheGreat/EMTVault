Regulation of the [[Respiratory System]] is done by the several organs. The **medulla oblongata** is the primary one, stimulating breathing based on CO2 levels. This is done by the **dorsal respiratory group** and the **ventral respiratory group**. The DRG is the primary piece and sends signals to the diaphragm through the phrenic nerves, starting inhalation.

The **pons** also regulates the DRG - the **pneumotaxic center** shuts off the DRG, while the apneustic center stimulates it. 

The **Hering-Breuer reflex** stops lungs from overinflating with stretch sensors.
