[[The Cell]] uses oxygen and glucose to harvest energy in **cellular respiration**. This takes place in 3 steps: glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and ETC. This process produces CO2, water, and ATP. With oxygen, one glucose can make 36 ATP. Half the energy is used to make ATP, the other half makes heat.

## Glycolysis
**Glycolysis** is the process that turns glucose into lactic acid and pyruvic acid. It is a form of anaerobic metabolism. One glucose becomes 2 NADH and 2 ATP.

## Krebs Cycle
This process needs oxygen and transforms NADH and fat into energy. Proteins are broken into amino acids, carbs into glucose, and fats into glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol and aminos are made into NADH, creating acetyl coenzyme A which releases energy when fully oxidized. Lactic acidosis can occur in shock due to excess anaerobic processes.

## ETC
Produces 34 ATP in an aerobic process. Electrons passively flow down the chain, pumping H+ ions, passing through ATP synthase to catalyze ATP production, and eventually joining with oxygen to create water.
