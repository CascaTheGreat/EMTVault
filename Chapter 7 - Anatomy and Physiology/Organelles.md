**Centrioles** assist mitosis, forming the structure that allows DNA to move. **Centrosome** is the [[Cytoplasm]] around the centrioles.

**Cilia and flagella** extend from cell surfaces. The Cilia move like hairs to sweep fluids though the cell in the respiratory and reproductive tracts. Flagella are longer and propel cells (sperm tail)

**Ribosomes** are made of protein and RNA and construct proteins from mRNA.

The **endoplasmic reticulum** is paths to move substances and protein between the nucleus and cell membrane. Smooth ER can make phospholipids and cholesterol, rough ER can has ribosomes.

**Golgi apparatus** is several flattened sacs, and regulates enzymes and hormones to leave the cell, packaging enzymes for internal use, and maintaining the cell membrane.

**Microfilaments** provide cell movement, usually in muscle cells.

**Mitochondria** regulate ATP production. They can migrate and self replicate.

**Peroxisomes** contain enzymes to catalyze reactions, especially in the liver to speed alcohol detoxification.

**Thick filaments** interact with actin to provide powerful contractions in muscles.

**Vesicles** transport materials between the exterior and interior of the cell.

**Nucleus** stores DNA that regulates cells, reproduction, and contains instructions for thousands of proteins. Skeletal muscles cells have multiple nuclei, and erythrocytes have none. The membranes allow only certain molecules to exit, and contain the nucleoplasm fluid.

**Nucleolus** is a mini nucleus in the nucleus made of RNA and proteins. Ribosomes are formed here.

**Chromatin** is loosely coiled DNA in the nucleus that forms chromosomes.
