The lower extremity is the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle, foot, and toes.

The **acetabulum** is the socket of the joint that connects the leg to the pelvis. The thigh contains the **femur**, the longest and strongest bone. The **femoral head** connect to the acetabulum. The upper section is the **greater trochanter**. Distal to the femur, the lateral and medial condyles articulate with the tibia. The **patella** lies in the major anterior thigh tendon. 

The leg is made of the tib and fib. The **tibia** is longer and thicker and has the shin. The **fibula** does not articulate with the femur, but with the tibia. The distal end forms the **lateral malleolus**. The knee is a hinge joint and contains ligaments in the joint. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents hyperextension of the tibia.

The talus articulates with tib/fib to form the ankle. The calcaneus (heel bone) provides support.
