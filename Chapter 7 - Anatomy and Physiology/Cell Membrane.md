The **membrane** of a cell hold structure and regulates movement into and out of the cell. The membrane also adheres to other cells. The outside of the membrane is *extracellular*, while the inside is *intracellular*.

The membrane is made of two layers of phosphates and phospholipids, allowing certain substances to pass through, making it **semipermeable**.

The cell membrane uses several proteins to operate.

**Channel proteins** allow passive transport into the cell.

**Enzyme receptors** allow for enzyme binding to catalyze reactions.

**Receptor sites** do the same but work with molecules.

**Identifier proteins** are an ID for a cell referenced by the immune system.

**Carrier proteins** bind to substances and transport them into the membrane.
