The upper extremity is the arm and down. the **humerus** is the bone of the upper arm. It articulates with the glenoid fossa at the shoulder and with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.

The forearm goes from elbow to wrist, containing the **radius** (thumb side) and **ulna**. The radius pivots around the ulna to rotate the palm. The proximal chunk is the radial head, the distal chunk has a small protrusion called the styloid process where ligaments attach.

The wrist is made of eight carpals. The carpal tunnel is formed by space between the trapezium, hamate, and a sheath of connective tissue. Nerves, tendons, and blood vessels are in the carpal tunnel.

The hand is made of **metacarpal bones**. The **phalanges** are a series of tiny bones that make the fingers. The **carpometacarpal joint** of the thumb is a saddle joint, allowing movement in two planes.
