The top of the [[Axial Skeleton]] is the skull which is made of 28 bones. There are three groups: the auditory ossicles, the **cranium**, and the face. The **auditory ossicles** function for hearing with three on each side of the head inside the temporal bone. The **mastoid process** is at the base of the temporal bone and is shaped like a cone for muscle attachment.

The **cranial vault** is made of eight bones to encase the brain: the parietal, temporal, frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. The spinal cord connects through the **foramen magnum**. The joints connecting skull bones are **sutures**. **Fontanelles** link the sutures, and close by around 2 years old.

**The cranial vault** is divided into the anterior, middle, and posterior fossa. The **crista galli** forms a ridge in the center of the anterior fossa and attaches to the meninges. The cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone which has openings (foramina) for the olfactory nerve is on either side.

16 bones form the face, 14 are facial bones (only do the face). They include the maxillae, mandible, zygoma, nasal, lacrimal, and vomer. The zygomatic arch gives shape to the cheeks.

The **orbit** is the fossa the encloses and protects the eyes. A blowout fracture is when the orbit breaks and blood and fat leak into the sinus.

The **nasal septum** is the separation between the nostrils. The external portion of the nose is mainly cartilage. The **paranasal sinuses** are hollowed sections of bone lined with mucous to decrease the skull's weight and give resonance for the voice. Sinusitis is the inflammation of this system.

The **mandible** is the lower jaw and teeth. The **temporomandibular joint** makes it the only movable skull bone.

The **hyoid bone** supports the tongue just below the mandible, but isn't actually part of the skull.
