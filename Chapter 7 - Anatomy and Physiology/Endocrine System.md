A complex message and control system made of glands. **Exocrine glands** excrete chemical to eliminate (sweat, salivary, and liver). **Endocrine glands** excrete for internal use into tissue and blood. Both release hormones that regulate body.

Hormones bind to cellular receptors, and are regulated by the [[Nervous System]]. **Agonists** are molecules that bind to receptors and make a response, **antagonists** prevent them from working.

The **pituitary gland** controls the secretion of other glands, located at the base of the brain. Regulated by the **hypothalamus**. Made of the anterior and posterior pituitary.
Anterior pituitary: growth hormones, thyroid-stimulating, adrenocorticotropic, three gonadotropic.
Posterior pituitary: ADH and oxytocin - synthesized by the hypothalamus and stored here until nerve signal

**Adrenocorticotropic hormone** releases in times of stress and tells the adrenal cortex to release **cortisol**.

The **thyroid gland** at the base of the neck makes growth, development, and metabolic hormones. Secretes **calcitonin** that maintains blood calcium by stimulating bone-building cells and the kidneys.

The **parathyroids** are embedded posterior to thyroids, produce **parathyroid hormone** that maintain blood calcium and muscular function opposing calcitonin.

Also in the [[Digestive System]], the **pancreas** contains the islet of Langerhans. They contain glucagon secreting **alpha cells** and insulin secreting **beta cells**. Delta cells make somatostatin. Insulin drops blood sugar, glucagon raises it. Insulin draws sugar, fat, and aminos into cells to be metabolized, encourages its storage, and stimulates conversion into **glycogen**. Somatostatin inhibits insulin and glucagon.

Glucagon stimulate glycogen to glucose conversion through **glycogenolysis**, and tells liver and kidneys to make glucose from nonstarches through **gluconeogenesis**. Also breaks triglycerides into fatty acid and glycerol. Unopposed glucagon at too high concentration brings on diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Adrenal glands** on top of the kidneys secrete sex hormones and mange water and salt balance. The inner **medulla** makes **adrenaline** and **norepinephrine** (catecholamines) which drive the sympathetic nervous system. 
The remainder of the gland is the adrenal cortex. It makes **corticosteroids** that that regulate metabolism, hydration, immune response, and sex.

The **reproductive glands** are the **gonads**: **testes** in men and **ovaries** in women. **Testes** primarily generate testosterone, which develop facial hair and a deeper voice.
The major female hormones are **estrogen**, **progesterone**, and **human chorionic gonadotropin**. If conception has occurred, the embryo makes hCG to thicken uterine lining and sustain the pregnancy. The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen drives the menstrual cycle and sex characteristics, progesterone prepares the uterus for conception. Small amounts of these two are made in the testes and adrenal glands.
