When two [[Long Bones]] come in contact, a joint is made. It consists of the bone ends and the connecting tissue. Many joints are named from a combination of the two meeting bones (sternoclavicular joint). Most joints allow motion (an articulation), while some are immobile (skull). Joints with limited motion held together by fibrous tissue are a **symphysis**.

The bone ends of a join are held together by the **joint capsule**. This sac is made of ligaments. The inner lining is the synovial membrane, which makes synovial fluid.

Joints can be **ball-and-socket joints** or **hinge joints**.
