The **circulatory system** covers veins, arteries, capillaries, and the heart. The two circuits are **systemic circulation** which goes through the body, and **pulmonary circulation**, which oxygenates [[Blood]] with the [[Respiratory System]]. 

The **heart** is the pump of the system, located behind the sternum. 2/3rds of it is in the left of the **mediastinum**, hence why the left lung has two nodes. The specific muscle of the heart is **myocardium**. The **pericardium** is the membrane sack that surrounds the heart. The visceral layer is the **epicardium**, separated from the sac by the **pericardial fluid**. **Endocardium** lines the interior of the heart. The heart has two atria and two ventricles, separated by the interatrial septum and interventricular septum respectively. Blood goes in the right atrium from the venae cavae and coronary sinus(body), is pumped to the lungs by the ventricle, returns at the left atrium, and leaves the left ventricle. Atria are separated from ventricles by semilunar valves. There is a depression between the atria called the **fossa ovalis**, a remnant of the **foramen ovale**.

The **tricuspid valve** is on the right side, the **mitral valve** (bicuspid) is on the left. **Papillary muscles** in the ventricles send **chordae tendineae** to the cusps. The aortic and pulmonic valves regulate blood flow and prevent backflow.

Electric signals control the heart with six parts in the **conduction system**: the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, bundle of His, left and right bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. The SA node is the normal origin of electrical impulses (like a pacemaker.)  They travel and contract the atria before reaching the AV node and slowing,. It continues to the bundle of His, branching into the left and right branches , then to the Purkinje fibers which contracts ventricles to systole.

The heart's **chronotropic state** (contraction rate control) and **dromotropic state** (rate of conduction control) and **inotropic state** (contraction strength control) are provided by the brain an autonomic nervous system, hormones, and endocrine system. **Baroreceptors** work on pressure change, **chemoreceptors** work on chemical composition change. **Alpha effects** occur with alpha receptor stimulation and vasoconstrict, **beta effects** increase the 3 states. Epinephrine works on beta, norepinephrine works on alpha.

The inner blood vessel lining is the **tunica intima**, the middle is the **tunica media**, the outer is the **tunica adventitia**. The tunica media allows for expansion and contraction.

**Coronary arteries** feed blood to the heart, and get blood in the diastolic phase. The right artery splits into nine branches (not for everyone), the left divides into two branches - **left anterior descending artery** and **circumflex coronary arteries**. When the conduction system isn't fed by the right artery, the left does it.

The **ascending aorta** branches into the left and right coronary arteries, then forming the **aortic arch** , which divides into three arteries including the **carotid artery**. The **descending aorta** goes down and divides into the iliac arteries in the pelvis.

The brachiocephalic artery is the first to branch off the arch and becomes the right common carotid and subclavian, feeding the head, neck, and anterior chest. The subclavian feeds into the brachial artery. The iliac arteries become the **femoral arteries** and then the **popliteal artery**. This branches into the two tibial arteries and the peroneal. The anterior tib becomes **dorsalis pedis artery**, while the posterior tib splits to fed the toes.

Veins usually accompany arteries and have the same name (jugular veins). The venous sinuses are the primary means of venous drainage from the cranium.
The **basilic vein** and **axillary vein** combine to the **axillary vein** in the arm which drains into the **subclavian** which then goes to the vena cava.
The **hepatic portal system** drains blood from abdominal organs like the liver, stomach, intestines, and spleen. Blood filters through the liver and feeds into the **hepatic veins**.
The great **saphenous vein** is the longest in the body and drains the lower extremity. It empties into the **femoral vein**.

**Blood pressure** measure the pressure against arterial walls and is measured by a **sphygmomanometer** in mmHg The state of blood vessels in terms of constriction and dilation is **systemic vascular resistance.**

[[Blood]] is unevenly distributed in the body, about 70% in the veins and 30% in the rest of the system. Nutrients move from the capillaries into the interstitial space and cells. Waste moves back into the capillaries. This works mainly on**hydrostatic pressure** - force of blood moving at high pressure in the arteries pushing the walls and forcing fluid out of capillaries, and **oncotic pressure** - osmosis pressure exerted by capillary proteins that tend to pull water in through diffusion. It's honestly just a pressure gradient.
