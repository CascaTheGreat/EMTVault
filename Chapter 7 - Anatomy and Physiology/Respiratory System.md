The **respiratory system** incudes the nose, mouth, throat, bronchi, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm.

The **upper airway** includes the nose, mouth, tongue, jaw, oral cavity, larynx, and pharynx. The tongue attaches to the mandible and hyoid bone. The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the oropharynx and nasopharynx. adenoids filter bacteria and viruses on the posterior nasopharyngeal wall. The larynx separates the upper and lower airway, made of bones cartilage and muscles that does not tolerate and foreign solid or liquids. The **nasopharynx** lies behind the nostrils and warms, filters, and humidifies air during breathing. The **epiglottis** protects the trachea as a thin, leaf-like valve. Only air can move past it into the larynx. 

The lower airway contains the trachea, bronchial tree, alveoli, and lungs. Gas exchange occurs here. Below the thyroid cartilage (adam's apple) is the cricoid cartilage. Below it is the trachea, a 5in long semirigid enclosed tube made of cartilage rings that are open in the back to allow food through the esophagus. It branches into the main stem bronchi at the carina. The entry point for bronchi, blood, and nerves into each lung is the **hilum**. Primary bronchi divide into secondary bronchi, each going to separate lobes of the lung. They branch countless times into bronchioles, which divide into alveolar ducts that end in alveoli. There are 300 million alveoli in the lungs. The **pulmonary-capillary membrane** is a single cell layer that diffuses CO2 and O2.

The **lungs** are the primary organs in breathing. 2 lobes on the left, 3 on the right, surrounded by the pleura, which resides in the pleural cavity. The cavity is lined by a pleural membrane called the **parietal pleura**. The lungs are covered by the **visceral pleura**. These membranes produce a lubricant to allow smooth movement in breathing. The **pleural space** exists between these two layers, though in normal function they are close and no space actually exists. Deoxygenated blood flows to the heart and to the lungs through the pulmonary artery and returns through the pulmonary veins when oxygenated.

The primary breathing muscle is the **diaphragm**, which contracts to let air draw in. The diaphragm exhibits characteristics of skeletal and smooth muscle, and can act as both. Inhalation is contraction, exhalation is relaxation. The bod inhales roughly 21% oxygen and exhales roughly 16%.

Breathing is controlled by the brainstem, with nerves here monitoring CO2 levels in the blood and attempting to maintain an [[Acid-Base Balance (anatomy)]]. A decrease in pH is **respiratory acidosis**, while an increase is **respiratory alkalosis**. Metabolic alkalosis and acidosis can also trigger changes, called "compensatory changes". Should this system fail, the hypoxic drive will stimulate breathing based on oxygen levels in arteries, but it is much less sensitive and powerful. This is part of the [[Nervous System Breathing Control]].

The typical adult male lung capacity is 6L, the tidal volume is 0.5L. **Inspiratory reserve volume** is the deepest breath you can take after a normal breath. **expiratory reserve volume** is the opposite. The gas that remains is the **residual volume**, typically about 3L. **Vital capacity** is the amount moved in and out with max inspiration and expiration. **Dead Space** is the portion of the system without alveoli (mouth, trachea, bronchi)
