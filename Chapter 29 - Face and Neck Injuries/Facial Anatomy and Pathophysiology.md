The external ear is made of the **pinna** which leads into the head to the ear canal.
Dental **malocclusion** is the misalignment of the teeth.

**Le Fort fractures** are in three categories:
- Le Fort 1 - horizontal that separates hard palate and lower maxilla
- Le Fort 2 - Nasal bone to inferior maxilla, separates nasal bone from facial skull
- Le Fort 3 - Separates midface from the cranium

Orbital fractures, such as **blowout fractures** may present with double vision, called **diplopia**.

When the conjunctiva become inflamed and red, this is **conjunctivitis**. Bandage both eyes if impaled to prevent **sympathetic eye movement**.

**Hyphema** is bleeding in the anterior chamber of the eye, can see blood in the iris. Another possible injury is **retinal detachment**.

A **basilar skull fracture** causes the posterior nasal cavity wall to become unstable. Each nasal chamber contains bone layers called **turbinates**. Membranes covering these turbinates warms and humidifies air.
